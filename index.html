<h2 id="3">Alternate-Day Fasting</h2>

<p>Alternate-day fasting can be highly beneficial for health and body composition. A typical approach is to alternate between a day of normal eating without calorie restriction, and a day of either no eating or a single meal limited to around 500 calories.</p>

<p>This has helped me become leaner and remain so long term, without feeling deprived of food. I find this much easier to follow and more effective than trying to continually restrict calories on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In the book "The Alternate-Day Diet" (Penguin 2013), Dr. James B. Johnson and Dr. Donald R. Laub Sr. explain that compared to daily calorie restriction, alternate-day fasting has additional hormonal effects that increase energy, reduce hunger, maintain basal metabolic rate,  and improve insulin response. While fasting, insulin blood levels decline and human growth hormone levels rise to burn fat. Cellular repair increases. Gene expression changes for disease prevention and longevity.</p>

<p>The book describes how people following this diet experience uplifted mood due to higher levels of circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cortisol, and nor-epinephrine. Studies found alternate-day fasting can benefit cognitive functioning, immune system, and pancreatic function, along with reduction of inflammation and oxidative damage for slower aging and lower risk of arthritis, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and stroke.</p>

<p><a href="https://thefastingmethod.com/the-science-of-intermittent-fasting/" title="The Science of Intermittent Fasting | The Fasting Method">Dr. Jason Fung</a> has seen how alternate-day fasting can significantly improve insulin sensitivity in patients, resulting in weight loss, reversal of type 2 diabetes, and reduced medication dependency. His article <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/does-fasting-burn-muscle-6cb1ddf44739" title="Does Fasting Burn Muscle? | Medium.com">Does Fasting Burn Muscle?</a> (Medium.com 2018) discusses clinical evidence that repeated alternate-day fasting does not cause muscle loss. Other reported benefits include reduction in waist circumference, body fat, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides.</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="4">Foods</h2>

<p>I choose "organic" when available and affordable for potentially lower <a href="https://detoxproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glyphosate_Contamination_Report_Final1.pdf" title="Glyphosate Contamination | DetoxProject.org">exposure</a> to <a href="https://www.mygenefood.com/blog/why-glyphosate-is-dangerous-and-how-to-avoid-eating-it/" title="Why Glyphosate is Dangerous, and How to Avoid Eating it | Gene Food">harmful</a> synthetic herbicides and pesticides. To reduce these, I wash produce and then soak in a sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) <a href="https://foodrevolution.org/blog/how-to-wash-vegetables-fruits/" title="How to Wash Vegetables and Fruits to Remove Pesticides | Food Revolution">solution</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/plant-based-diet-guide" title="Whole-Foods, Plant-Based Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide | Healthline">Studies</a> have <a href="https://www.pcrm.org/clinical-research" title="Clinical Research | Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine">shown</a> that a diet emphasizing a variety of whole plant foods with minimal processing can (1) improve digestion and immune system health; (2) stabilize blood sugar and benefit weight loss; (3) lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and inflammation; (4) reduce risk of arthritis, cancer, cognitive decline, diabetes, mental illness, obesity, and stroke; and (5) prevent and reverse heart disease.</p>

<p>I regularly consume these:</p>

<ul>
    <li>purified water from APEC RO-CTOP countertop reverse osmosis water filter</li>

    <li>raw fresh, dried, and frozen fruits (eaten whole, blended, or mixed in dishes)</li>

    <li>raw beet, carrot, celery, cucumber, garlic, ginger root, napa cabbage, onion, parsley, pepper, radish, red cabbage, sprouts, tomato (eaten whole, blended, or mixed in dishes), and other plants</li>

    <li>homemade <a href="#9" title="Another section">sauerkraut</a> (fermented cabbage)</li>

    <li>bok choy, broccoli, brussels sprouts, collard greens, green beans, kale, mushroom, mustard greens, turnip greens, zucchini squash, and other plants (<a href="#50" title="Another section">stir-fry with water</a>)</li>

    <li>sliced potatoes and sweet potatoes (simmered in minimal water, or <a href="#50" title="Another section">stir-fry with water</a>)</li>

    <li><a href="#5" title="Another section">lentils</a> (sprouted and simmered in minimal water)</li>

    <li>mixed <a href="#5" title="Another section">beans and chickpeas</a> (baked in large amount to store in freezer; thawed as needed to mix in dishes, hummus, and soups)</li>

    <li>amaranth, buckwheat, non-GMO corn, oats, quinoa, and sorghum (simmered in water, <a href="#6" title="Another section">multigrain gluten-free flatbread</a>, corn bread and tortillas)</li>

    <li>basmati and jasmine <a href="#65" title="Another section">rice</a> (from sources tested lowest in arsenic; prepared using method to reduce arsenic by 82%)</li>

    <li>non-GMO popcorn (hot air popper)</li>

    <li>raw nuts and seeds (favorites: <a href="#7" title="Another section">flax</a>, pumpkin, sesame, sunflower, walnuts), dry-roasted peanuts, raw coconut and coconut oil, olive oil (sources <a href="https://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/" title="UC Davis Olive Center">tested</a> for purity), fresh avocado</li>

    <li><a href="#8" title="Another section">salt</a>, spices, herbs (Some may <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antiviral-herbs" title="15 Impressive Herbs with Antiviral Activity | Healthline">have</a> antiviral <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ptr.7019" title="Spices and herbs: Potential antiviral preventives and immunity boosters during COVID-19 | Wiley">properties</a>.

<h3>Kitchen</h3>

<p>I use glass dishes, glass and stainless steel water containers, glass containers for storing cooked food, and stainless steel mixing bowls and utensils. I use <a href="https://ireadlabelsforyou.com/skinny-safe-cookware/" title="Safe Cookware Guide That Makes Sense | Irina Webb">cookware</a> made of carbon steel, cast iron, and <a href="https://myersdetox.com/nickel-toxicity/" title="Nickel Toxicity | Wendy Myers">nickel-free</a> stainless steel.</p>

<p>Cook’s Illustrated <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5820-the-ultimate-way-to-season-cast-iron" title="The Ultimate Way to Season Cast Iron | Cook’s Illustrated">found</a> flaxseed oil to be the most durable type of fat for seasoning cast iron cookware. From prolonged exposure to high heat, flaxseed oil forms a smooth, hard polymer that bonds to cast iron and protects from rust.</p>

<p>When I bought a Cuisinel 13.5" round cast iron griddle, initially I used a power sander with 50-grit sandpaper to remove the factory seasoning and smooth the cooking surface. To maintain my own seasoning, I apply a thin light coat of flaxseed oil on the clean griddle and place it upside down in the oven to bake at 450 °F (232 °C) for one hour, with range hood fan on and windows open for ventilation. Afterward I allow the cookware to cool in the closed oven for a few hours. With appropriate care, I find this natural coating in daily use will last up to a year.</p>

<h2 id="8">Dietary Salt</h2>

<h3>Sodium</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/12/e003733" title="Global, regional and national sodium intakes in 1990 and 2010 | BMJ">estimated</a> adult world average for sodium is 3950 mg/day. The American Heart Association and NASEM issued guidelines for healthy adults to limit consumption of sodium to 1500 mg/day. However, doing so may actually increase mortality.</p>

<p>Dr. Jason Fung notes in <a href="https://medium.com/@drjasonfung/the-salt-scam-1973d73dccd" title="The Salt Scam | Medium.com">The Salt Scam</a> (Medium.com 2018) that consuming enough sodium is vital for maintaining healthy blood pressure and volume. He describes two large studies that found people with a low sodium intake had 15-18% higher mortality, compared to those with the highest sodium intake. Other trials found that among treated hypertensive patients, those who ate a low sodium diet had increased risk of heart attack.</p>

<p>Similar <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27216139/" title="Associations of urinary sodium excretion with cardiovascular events… | PubMed">findings</a> came from a pooled analysis of four studies comprising 133,000 people in 49 countries. Regardless of blood pressure, those who consumed less than 3000 mg/day sodium had significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death, compared to people consuming 4000–5000 mg/day sodium. Among those who consumed over 7000 mg/day sodium, there was increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death for people with hypertension, but not for people with normal blood pressure.</p>

<h3>Purified</h3>

<p>I prefer dietary salt (sodium chloride) that is mined from ancient underground mineral deposits and purified by the manufacturer. One such product with no additives is Morton Canning & Pickling Salt. A packed leveled 1 US teaspoon contains approximately 3000 mg sodium. I get <a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a> from a better source than dietary salt.</p>

<h3>Microplastics</h3>

<p>A 2018 <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04180" title="Global Pattern of Microplastics (MPs) in Commercial Food-Grade Salts | ACS">study</a> found 25 of 28 different commercial sea salts from around the world contained an abundance of microplastics due to polluted seawater. On average, rock salt (mined from underground) had far less. <a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/microplastics-bowel-diseases/" title="Microplastics contaminating food and drinks may be fueling a dramatic rise in bowel diseases | studyfinds.org">Microplastic</a> particles are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time" title="Microplastics found in human blood for first time | theguardian.com">linked</a> to adverse effects on health.</p>

<h3>Toxic Lead</h3>

<p>Despite marketing claims, unpurified gourmet specialty salts <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pink-himalayan-salt" title="Is Pink Himalayan Salt Better Than Regular Salt? | Healthline">do not</a> contain significant amounts of minerals other than sodium chloride. However, some may contain higher amounts of toxic lead than purified salt. For example, a 2020 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7603209/" title="An Analysis of the Mineral Composition of Pink Salt Available in Australia | PubMed">study</a> found 29 of 31 different samples of Himalayan pink salt had higher lead levels than purified table salt, on average 2.5 times more. Excluded from the average as an outlier, one sample of Himalayan pink salt had 129.5 times more lead than purified table salt.</p>

<p>Lead is a toxic heavy metal that can accumulate in the body. Elevated lead levels are common and associated with significantly <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/lead-toxicity-4th-leading-killer/" title="Lead Toxicity 4th Leading Killer | Bill Sardi">increased</a> risk of disease and mortality. High-dose oral <a href="#16" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> and crushed raw garlic can assist the body in reducing lead levels.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="5">Legumes</h2>

<p>A staple food in many cultures, legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils, peas) are high in protein, fiber, and polyphenols with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4608274/" title="Legumes: Health Benefits and Culinary Approaches to Increase Intake | PubMed">Studies</a> have shown that legumes can (1) benefit weight control; (2) reduce blood glucose levels and risk of type 2 diabetes; (3) reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and risk of heart disease; and (4) <a href="https://dailyhealthpost.com/beans-cut-risk-of-cancer/" title="Eating Beans And Other Legumes Help Cut The Risk of 5 Deadly Cancers | Daily Health Post">reduce</a> risk of several types of cancer.</p>

<h3>Lentils</h3>

<p>I simmer sprouted lentils in water, adding salt and spices as desired. Sprouting makes the lentils easier to digest and require less cooking time. Sprouting method: In a stainless steel stock pot, soak dried lentils overnight which increases their volume by approximately 2.7 times. Drain, rinse, and cover with lid to keep out light. Rinse the lentils once a day for several days, then store in refridgerator.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kuchpakrahahai.in/mixed-lentils-dosa-mixed-dal-dosa/" title="Instant Mixed Dal Dosa (Lentil Dosa) Recipe">Lentil dosas</a> are a thin, crispy crepe popular in India. After soaking, the lentils are blended, fermented (optional), and cooked on a stove-top griddle.</p>

<p>A 1/2 US cup of raw lentils (96 g) <a href="https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4337/2" title="lentils | nutritiondata.self.com">contains</a> an estimated 25 g protein (50% DV), 29 g fiber (104% DV), 460 mg folate (115% RDI), 7 mg iron (39–88% RDI), 117 mg magnesium (28% RDI), and 917 mg potassium (20% RDI).</p>

<h3>Baked Beans and Chickpeas</h3>

<p>I use baked beans in various dishes, hummus, and soups. The following method allows me to prepare enough to eat for several weeks. I find that soaking, rinsing, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and high oven heat greatly reduces the gas-forming compounds, making the beans easy to digest.</p>

<p>Add 20 US cups of mixed dried beans to 20 US quart stainless steel stock pot (e.g. Crestware). Fill with water, soak for 12–24 hours, drain, and rinse. Add 1 US teaspoon sodium bicarbonate dissolved in water. Fill with water until beans begin to float. Bake at 450 °F (232 °C) for two hours. Turn off heat and leave beans in closed oven. After several hours, remove and scoop beans into seven "7-Cup round glass food storage containers". Put one container in refridgerator to eat during the week. Put other six containers in freezer. As needed, remove one container a day before use and thaw in refridgerator.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="6">Multigrain Gluten-Free Flatbread</h2>

<p>Flatbread can be a quick, delicious way to prepare a variety of grain-like foods. My favorites are amaranth, buckwheat, non-GMO corn, quinoa, and sorghum. I grind these a half pound at a time for about a minute, using my Vitamix blender set at low/variable speed 10. I mix these together into multigrain flour and store in the freezer, to keep on hand for use in the following recipe.</p>

<p>In a mixing bowl add 1/2 US cup water, 1/4 US teaspoon citric acid crystals, and salt as desired. Stir until dissolved. Add 1 US cup flour, 1/4 US teaspoon sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), 1/4 US teaspoon guar gum powder, and spices as desired. Stir into thick batter, adding more flour or water if needed. Sprinkle a thin layer of flour onto griddle to prevent sticking. Scoop batter onto griddle, flatten, and sprinkle with flour. Cook both sides at moderate heat on stove.</p>

<p>Optional: Sodium bicarbonate and citric acid leaven the bread. 1 US tablespoon lemon juice or 2 US tablespoons vinegar can replace citric acid. Guar gum powder comes from the seed of a bean-like plant and is commonly used as a thickening agent in gluten-free baking.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="7">Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h2>

<h3>Flaxseed</h3>

<p>Flaxseed is high in short-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants. This may have a mild estrogenic effect, but overall the benefits appear to be significant. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/flaxseeds" title="Flax Seeds 101: Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits | Healthline">Studies</a> indicate flaxseed may improve blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as reduce risk of heart disease, inflammation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and several types of cancer.</p>

<p>I regularly eat raw flaxseed. I use an electric grinder (KitchenAid blade coffee and spice grinder combo pack) to reduce this into flour and then add a little water, dried fruit, and spices.</p>

<h3>Algae Oil</h3>

<p>An option for supplementation is preformed EPA and DHA (long-chain omega-3 fatty acids) from <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/algae-oil" title="What Is Algae Oil, and Why Do People Take It? | Healthline">algae oil</a>, derived from phytoplankton grown under controlled conditions in fresh water and purified. Phytoplankton are in a different biological kingdom than blue-green algae which may contain toxins.</p>

<h3>Toxic Seafood</h3>

<p>Seafood may contain pollutants such as dioxin, mercury and other toxic heavy metals, microplastics, oil spill dispersants, PCBs, pesticides, and radiation. From various studies with mixed findings, there is question whether supplemental fish oil would be beneficial. Even after molecular distillation, there may still be toxic contaminants. Fish oil is often an industry waste product and highly susceptible to becoming rancid, with potential for induced oxidative damage and increased inflammation.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="27">Protein</h2>

<p>Beginning in 1910, nutritional pioneer and physician <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307089569_Mikkel_Hindhede_1862-1945_A_pioneering_nutritionist" title="Mikkel Hindhede (1862-1945): A pioneering nutritionist | ResearchGate">Dr. Mikkel Hindhede</a> did several laboratory studies on human nutrition sponsored by the government of Denmark. Using adult test subjects (including farmers working long hours), he determined that 20–25 g/day protein from vegetarian foods is sufficient to maintain nitrogen balance and muscle mass for good health. In a publication he notes, "You don’t have to be concerned about protein. You always get enough of this nutrient, it is more important not to get too much."</p>

<p>The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) published a Daily Value of 50 g/day protein for healthy adults consuming 2000 calories/day. For "safety" reasons, they arrived at this value by doubling the average adult requirement found by research studies to be 0.4 g/day protein per kg of body weight, equivalent to 22–33 g/day protein for adults weighing 120–180 lbs (54.5–81.7 kg).</p>

<p>Studies find that frequently consuming large amounts of animal proteins is associated with increased risk of adverse effects on health. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpts from Ocean Robbins. <a href="https://foodrevolution.org/blog/study-deadly-as-smoking/" title="Study: Eating meat and cheese as deadly as smoking? | FoodRevolution.org">Study: Eating meat and cheese as deadly as smoking?</a> Food Revolution 2014.</p>

<p>"That chicken wing you’re eating could be as deadly as a cigarette. In a new study that tracked a large sample of adults for nearly two decades, researchers have found that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer than someone with a low-protein diet — a mortality risk factor comparable to smoking."</p>

<p>"Not only is excessive protein consumption linked to a dramatic rise in cancer mortality, but middle-aged people who eat lots of proteins from animal sources — including meat, milk and cheese — are also more susceptible to early death in general, reveals the study to be published March 4 in Cell Metabolism. Protein-lovers were 74 percent more likely to die of any cause within the study period than their more low-protein counterparts. They were also several times more likely to die of diabetes."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a video with transcript, <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/animal-protein-compared-cigarette-smoking/" title="Animal Protein Compared to Cigarette Smoking | NutritionFacts.org">Dr. Michael Greger</a> explains how consuming large amounts of animal proteins can promote cancer from excess release of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) by the liver. A diet based on whole plant foods with minimal processing can significantly lower IGF-1 levels within days to suppress cancer growth.</p>

<p>For 40+ years Dr. Dean Ornish and colleagues at the nonprofit <a href="https://pmri.org/" title="Preventive Medicine Research Institute">Preventive Medicine Research Institute</a>, in collaboration with scientists and medical institutions, have conducted a series of randomized controlled trials and demonstration projects showing that lifestyle change including a whole-food plant-based diet can slow and reverse the progression of chronic diseases including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="65">Rice</h2>

<p>Many sources of rice have been found to be high in toxic inorganic <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/arsenic-in-rice" title="Arsenic in Rice: Should You Be Concerned? | Healthline">arsenic</a>, which is classified as a group-A human carcinogen. Long-term ingestion of arsenic can lead to blocking of blood vessels, heart disease, high blood pressure, impaired brain function, nerve damage, type 2 diabetes, and various types of cancer.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1892142/" title="Food Safety: U.S. Rice Serves Up Arsenic | PubMed">studies</a> by scientists Andrew Meharg and John Duxbury, basmati rice (grown in India and Pakistan) and jasmine rice (grown in Thailand) were found to contain the least amount of arsenic. Consumer Reports had similar findings, with organic basmatic rice (grown in California) also testing among the lowest for arsenic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cookinglight.com/syndication/how-to-reduce-arsenic-in-rice" title="Use This Cooking Hack to Reduce Arsenic Levels in Your Rice | cookinglight.com">Method</a> by Andrew Meharg found to reduce arsenic content of rice by 82%:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Soak rice in water overnight. This opens the grain’s structure and allows water-soluble arsenic within to release.</li>
    <li>Drain rice in the morning and rinse with clean water.</li>
    <li>For every one part of rice, add five parts of water to a cooking pot.</li>
    <li>Cook rice until tender. Avoid cooking until dry since released arsenic will be reabsorbed.</li>
    <li>Drain excess water from rice and rinse with clean hot water.</li>
</ol>

<hr class="gradient" />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="9">Sauerkraut</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-sauerkraut" title="8 Surprising Benefits of Sauerkraut | Healthline">Studies</a> found that raw sauerkraut with probiotic bacteria can benefit bones, brain, digestion, heart, immune system, and reduce risk of cancer. Sauerkraut is a potent stimulant for production of stomach acid, which in deficiency is an underlying cause of many intestinal problems. I regularly eat sauerkraut and make it using the following method.</p>

<p>Weigh chopped cabbage on food scale. Calculate 2% of cabbage weight (e.g. 1000 g cabbage × 0.02 = 20 g salt) and measure that amount of salt on food scale. Add cabbage and salt to powerful blender or food processor. Blend to a thick consistency, gradually adding water and pushing down as needed.</p>

<p>Scoop the blended mixture to fill glass canning jars. Label with current date, attach lids, and place the jars on a tray in a dark location at 60–75 °F (16–24 °C) for 4–8 weeks, depending on temperature.</p>

<p>Afterward rinse any expelled liquid from the jars and refridgerate. Properly fermented sauerkraut can keep for many months when stored at the temperature 35 °F (2 °C) of a typical refrigerator. The benefits of probiotics are lost when heated above 106 °F (41 °C).</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="50">Vegetable Stir-Fry With Water</h2>

<p>Cooking vegetables briefly at high heat can be a quick, delicious way to prepare them. I prefer the following method with minimal water, instead of heavy oil commonly used.</p>

<p>Preheat empty wok for one minute at highest setting on stove. Add finely diced vegetables and briefly cook. Keep the vegetables moving with a wok spatula and periodically add minimal water to prevent sticking. Immediately afterward empty the wok, clean in sink, briefly reheat to evaporate moisture, and rub with minimal oil to prevent rust.</p>

<p>I use a Honey-Can-Do Origins / Joyce Chen 14" flat-bottom wok made of heavy 1.8-mm 15-gauge spun carbon steel for resistance against warping. Mine has remained flat. A mallet could reshape it if needed. The wok came from the Taiwan manufacturer with a clear protective coating, which I removed from the cooking surface by repeatedly scrubbing with fine steel wool and wiping away the powder residue with isopropyl alcohol on tissue paper.</p>

<hr />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="10">Vitamins & Minerals</h2>

<p>Unlike pharmaceutical drugs <a href="https://doctorfarrah.com/2022/02/14/prescription-drugs-are-the-true-killers/" title="Prescription Drugs Are the True Killers | DoctorFarrah.com">which</a> kill many people each year, vitamin and mineral supplements have a high safety profile and caused no deaths in 2021 <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v19n06.shtml" title="Supplement Safety Confirmed by America's Largest Database | Orthomolecular.org">per</a> the National Poison Data System.</p>

<p>For inexpensive sources of quality supplements, I look for an established reputation with good manufacturing practices and buy in quantity when discounted. Bulk powder/crystal forms can be economical and without additives. Store securely away from young children and pets.</p>

<p>I regularly take these:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#11" title="Another section">boron</a> 8 mg/day from borax solution, in water drank throughout the day. Sources of boron in smaller amounts include whole plant foods, depending where grown.</li>

    <li><a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a> 18+ mg/day from potassium iodide solution, in water drank throughout the day.</li>

    <li><a href="#13" title="Another section">magnesium</a> 600+ mg/day (Enviromedica.com Ancient Minerals magnesium chloride flakes | Vitacost.com magnesium citrate 400 mg magnesium per serving 240 tablets) in water drank throughout the day. Whole plant foods are a good source of magnesium.</li>

    <li><a href="#35" title="Another section">niacin</a> (immediate-release nicotinic acid) up to 3 g/day (BulkSupplements.com niacin vitamin B3 powder 1 kg 2.2 lbs) in water drank throughout the day.</li>

    <li id="37">selenium 200 mcg/day (Vitacost.com Selenium Select 200 mcg 300 capsules, as L-selenomethionine) with food. After using up that supply, I plan to switch to selenium yeast for <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n30.shtml" title="…The Roles of Cysteine and Selenocysteine | Orthomolecular.org">methylselenocysteine</a>, a highly bioavailable form that has produced positive results in clinical cancer studies. Depending where grown, good sources of selenium can be whole grains, seeds, and nuts, particularly brazil nuts with 50–100 mcg selenium in each nut. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/selenium-benefits" title="7 Science-Based Health Benefits of Selenium | Healthline">Studies</a> found that selenium is important for immune system and thyroid function. It acts as an antioxidant that may prevent mental decline, protect against heart disease, and reduce risk of <a href="https://seleniumfacts.com/index.php/category/cancer" title="Cancer Archives | SeleniumFacts.com">cancer</a>. 800 mcg/day selenium is the level of U.S. no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and maximum long-term dosage considered safe of any side effects. Renowned selenium researcher Gerhard N. Schrauzer <a href="https://www.curezone.org/diseases/cancer/selenium.asp" title="Selenium for Cancer | curezone.org">found</a> that regular dosages of 2000–5000 mcg/day could be used without toxicity for several months, at which point early toxicity symptoms began to be observed. He <a href="https://seleniumfacts.com/index.php/dr-schrauzer-selenium-researcher" title="Dr. Gerhard N. Schrauzer - renowned selenium researcher | SeleniumFacts.com">suggested</a> 200–300 mcg/day selenium to prevent cancer.</li>

    <li id="38">vitamin A (SwansonVitamins.com Swanson Premium vitamin A 10,000 IU 3000 mcg RAE 250 sgels) 1 every 2 days, the equivalent of 1500 mcg/day RAE. This is preformed vitamin A as retinol, not beta-carotene. I take this with dietary fat to increase absorption. Vitamin A is important for gene expression, immune function, and vision. I regularly eat carrots and sweet potatoes which are high in provitamin A (carotenoids).</li>

    <li id="66">vitamin B-100 complex (SwansonVitamins.com Swanson Premium Balance B-100 complex high potency 300 caps | Vitacost.com Complete B-100 complex 300 capsules) with food. I open a capsule and sprinkle out a small amount. Any excess amounts of water-soluble B vitamins pass through the body and are not stored. Whole plant foods contain B vitamins, except for B12 which is naturally present in animal foods.</li>

    <li>vitamin B12&nbsp; 500 mcg/day (Natrol Vitamin B12 Fast Dissolve tablets 5000 mcg 100 Count) from tablet divided into 10 doses, 1 dose/day chewed and dissolved in mouth. Absorption is increased when supplemental B12 is mixed with saliva. I also make my own B12 intranasal supplement for increased absorption, as <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/nasal.html" title="Nasal Administration of Vitamin B-12 | Andrew W. Saul">described</a> by Andrew Saul. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/methylcobalamin-vs-cyanocobalamin" title="Methylcobalamin vs. Cyanocobalamin: What’s the Difference? | Healthline">Studies</a> indicate that cyanocobalamin is well suited for oral B12 supplementation and considered nontoxic for healthy adults. B12 in a multivitamin/mineral supplement may be less bioavailable due to interaction with other nutrients. B12 deficiency is common, particularly among elderly and people who do not regularly eat animal foods.</li>

<h3>Iron</h3>

<p>It is estimated that 80% of the world’s population does not have enough iron in their bodies, and 30% have iron-deficiency <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/iron-deficiency-inadequate-dietary-iron" title="Iron Deficiency Anemia Secondary to Inadequate Dietary Iron Intake | Healthline">anemia</a>.</p>

<p>Cooking wet acidic food (e.g. with citric acid or vinegar) in uncoated cast iron cookware can significantly <a href="https://whatscookingamerica.net/information/ironcastiron.htm" title="Iron and Carcinogens in Cast Iron | What’s Cooking America">increase</a> iron content of the food, with care to dry the cookware afterward to avoid rust. Iron absorption can be <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/increase-iron-absorption" title="How to Increase the Absorption of Iron From Foods | Healthline">increased</a> by taking vitamin C with the meal and by waiting at least <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/106/6/1413/4823172" title="A 1-h time interval between a meal containing iron and consumption of tea… | Oxford Academic">an hour</a> for digestion before consuming coffee, tea, dairy, or supplements with calcium, magnesium, and zinc.</p>

<h3>Calcium</h3>

<p>For <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n22.shtml" title="Bone Health and Osteoporosis: An Orthomolecular Perspective | Orthomolecular.org">bone health</a>, I do weight-bearing exercise and also consider my intake of boron, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin K. I consume sufficient calcium from food sources. <a href="https://www.peakenergy.com" title="Dr. Thomas E. Levy | PeakEnergy.com">Dr. Thomas E. Levy</a> notes the following in his book about calcium:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD. Death by Calcium (1st ed., pp. 35–36). MedFox 2013.</p>

<p>You are 30% more likely to have a heart attack and up to 20% more likely to have a stroke if you take an extra 500 mg of calcium or more per day — that’s the consensus derived from a comprehensive review of 15 independent clinical investigations. The reviewing researchers reported that subjects taking calcium supplements (500 mg or more per day) had a 27 to 31% higher risk of heart attack and a 12 to 20% greater risk of stroke.</p>

<p>Dump more calcium into the caldron and the brew becomes even more deadly. A study of over 61,000 participants viewed over a 19-year period concludes that those with calcium intakes over 1,400 mg/day had an alarming 40% increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in general and a 114% increase in risk of death from a reduced flow of blood to the heart muscle (ischemic heart disease).</p>

<h2 id="11">Boron</h2>

<p>Boron is important for vitamin D and parathyroid glands that regulate calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus for healthy bones, joints, and teeth. Boron supplementation may benefit testosterone and estrogen levels, as well as cognition and memory. Boron deficiency can lead to arthritis and calcification of soft tissues. I found this to be a comprehensive summary of related research:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Lara Pizzorno, MDiv, MA, LMT. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712861/" title="Nothing Boring About Boron | PubMed">Nothing Boring About Boron</a>. Integrative Medicine: A Clinician’s Journal 2015;14(4):35–48.</p>

<p>Boron has been proven to be an important trace mineral because it (1) is essential for the growth and maintenance of bone; (2) greatly improves wound healing; (3) beneficially impacts the body’s use of estrogen, testosterone, and vitamin D; (4) boosts magnesium absorption; (5) reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as hs-CRP and TNF-α; (6) raises levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; (7) protects against pesticide-induced oxidative stress and heavy-metal toxicity; (8) improves brain electrical activity, cognitive performance, and short-term memory in elders; (9) influences the formation and activity of key biomolecules, such as SAM-e and NAD+; (10) has demonstrated preventive and therapeutic effects in a number of cancers, such as prostate, cervical, and lung cancers and multiple and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and (11) may help ameliorate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutic agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Borax</h3>

<p>Borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) contains boron and is a natural mineral mined from dried salt lakes. Borax has a long history of use in small amounts as a food preservative, but is no longer commonly used for that purpose due to concerns of prolonged excessive ingestion of boron.</p>

<p>Borax is <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/borictech.html#cancer" title="Boric Acid and Its Sodium Borate Salts - Carcinogenicity | NPIC">classified</a> by the U.S. EPA as "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans" under the 2005 carcinogen assessment guidelines. The U.S. EPA <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/borictech.html#acute" title="Boric Acid and Its Sodium Borate Salts - Acute Toxicity | NPIC">considers</a> borax to be low in acute toxicity, with an oral LD<sub>50</sub> (median lethal dose) of 4550–4980 mg/kg (per kg of body weight) based on rat testing. In comparison, the oral LD<sub>50</sub> for dietary salt (sodium chloride) is 3000 mg/kg.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.health-science-spirit.com/Healing_the_Body/The-Borax-Conspiracy.html" title="The Borax Conspiracy | Walter Last">article</a> by Walter Last mentions that in the 1960s, Dr. Rex Newnham found borax to be effective for arthritis and widely sold the treatment in Australia until pharmaceutical industry lobbied authorities to prohibit it. In publications Dr. Newnham suggests an adult oral dosage equivalent to 9 mg/day boron for 1–3 months until arthritis symptoms resolve, followed by a maintenance dosage of 3 mg/day boron. His research includes a double-blind trial which showed 70% of people with arthritis greatly improved from the treatment, though initially a Herxheimer reaction may occur. Some had improvement in heart disease, energy levels, and overall health. Dr. Newnham notes low arthritis rates (1% or less) in regions with high boron levels in the environment, such as Israel with an estimated dietary intake of 5–8 mg/day boron.</p>

<p>In online groups, people report successful use of borax for various conditions such as Candida and other fungal infections, lupus and other autoimmune diseases, mycotoxins, and removal of toxic heavy metals and fluoride from the body.</p>

<h3>Homemade Solution</h3>

<p>20 Mule Team Borax has been manufactured since 1891 from one of the world’s largest borax deposits in California. The only processing it receives after its removal from the ground is washing, drying, and packaging. The product is packaged in its pure form with no chemical additives. The product is 99.5% pure and the remaining 0.5% contains naturally occurring trace minerals, with no risk of toxic heavy metals. Pharmaceutical-grade borax is not noticeably purer or better.</p>

<p>To make a borax solution, I add packed leveled 1.5 US teaspoons of borax powder (average 6930 mg on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale) and 1 US cup of purified water into a cooking pot. I heat on the stove until the solution boils for one minute and stir until the borax is dissolved. I pour the solution into a labeled glass bottle, tightly seal with cap, and store securely in a dark location. Each 0.5 US teaspoon of this solution contains approximately 8 mg boron, which is well under the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 20 mg/day boron, determined unlikely to cause any adverse effects for healthy adults in long-term use.</p>

<p>6930 mg borax powder × 0.113 (11.3% boron by weight) = 783 mg boron, ÷ 96 (number of 0.5 US teaspoon in 1 US cup water) = 8 mg boron</p>

<h2 id="12">Iodine</h2>

<p><a href="#58" title="Another section">Research</a> | <a href="#59" title="Another section">Formulation & Dosage</a> | <a href="#60" title="Another section">Homemade Solution</a> | <a href="#61" title="Another section">My Experience</a></p>

<p>For adult intake of iodine, the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) published a Reference Daily Intake (previously RDA) of 150 mcg/day and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 1100 mcg/day for adults. However, much higher dosages are suggested by physicians and researchers experienced with the use of iodine for optimal health and healing.</p>

<h3 id="58">Research</h3>

<p>Dr. Guy E. Abraham, Dr. Jorge D. Flechas, Dr. David Brownstein, and others published their iodine studies in a series of journal articles, made freely available by <a href="https://www.optimox.com/iodine-research" title="Iodine Research | Optimox">Optimox</a>. Their research indicates that supplemental iodine can protect against radiation, has an anticarcinogenic effect throughout the body, and assists with excretion of toxic halides and heavy metals. Other potential benefits include improved blood sugar, cardiac rhythm, cognitive functioning, immune system, and response to thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency is a causative factor in breast cancer, fibrocystic breast disease, and thyroid conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Graves’ disease, and Hashimoto’s disease.</p>

<p>On a related note, Dr. Brownstein has found that food sensitivity is a major cause of autoimmune-related thyroid conditions and that an elimination diet is important for recovery. Avoiding common allergens such as <a href="https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/gluten-root-cause-thyroid-condition/" title="Is Gluten the Root Cause of Your Thyroid Condition? | thyroidpharmacist.com">gluten</a>, <a href="https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/going-dairy-free-to-reverse-hashimotos/" title="Going Dairy Free to Reverse Hashimoto’s | thyroidpharmacist.com">dairy</a>, <a href="https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/soy-and-hashimotos/" title="How Avoiding Soy Can Benefit Hashimoto’s | thyroidpharmacist.com">soy</a>, and <a href="https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/elimination-diet-for-hashimotos/" title="Uncover Your Hashimoto’s Root Cause with an Elimination Diet | thyroidpharmacist.com">other</a> foods can be beneficial. Also coffee and green tea have a high level of catechin, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23117228/" title="Catechin induced modulation in the activities of thyroid hormone… | PubMed">found</a> to reduce active thyroid hormone in circulation.</p>

<p>In the book "Breast Cancer and Iodine" (Trafford 2001), Dr. David Derry explains research that shows iodine supplementation can prevent several disease processes. Taking over 3 mg/day iodine will saturate the thyroid and allow iodine to perform other bodily functions. Iodine can (1) trigger the death of abnormal cells to prevent spread of cancer; (2) protect against autoimmune disease by coating allergic proteins to make them non-allergic; (3) deactivate biological and chemical poisons; and (4) eliminate harmful viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lynnefarrow.net/" title="LynneFarrow.net">Lynn Farrow</a> treated her breast cancer with iodine, became a patient-activist, and <a href="http://www.iodineresearch.com/research.html" title="IodineResearch.com">researched</a> iodine for several years. Her book "The Iodine Crisis: What You Don’t Know About Iodine Can Wreck Your Life" (Devon 2013) describes the history of iodine, causes of deficiency, protocols, and frequently asked questions. Included are examples of successful use for allergy, atrial fibrillation, Candida, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, cyst, depression, eczema, endometriosis, estrogen imbalance, fatigue, fibrocystic breast disease, fibromyalgia, gum bleeding, herpes, hypertension, low libido, low testosterone, lung condition, menstrual pain, migraine headache, nodule, palpitations, prostate disease, psoriasis, Raynaud’s disease, sinus infection, thyroid condition, type 2 diabetes, and uterine fibroids.</p>

<h3 id="59">Formulation & Dosage</h3>

<p>In the book "Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can’t Live Without It" (Medical Alternatives 2014), <a href="https://www.drbrownstein.com/" title="Dr. Brownstein’s Holistic Medicine | DrBrownstein.com">Dr. Brownstein</a> details how for decades he has recommended iodine supplementation to nearly every patient, with typical adult oral dosages of 12–50 mg/day iodine and for some diseases up to 150 mg/day. In his experience the best formulation clinically is a combination of potassium iodide (KI) and molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), as found in Lugol’s solution first made by Dr. J.G.A. Lugol in 1829.</p>

<p>Two vertical drops of 5% Lugol’s solution contain a total of 12.5 mg iodine, from 5 mg molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) and 7.5 mg iodide. Iodide (I-) is the ionic state of the chemical element iodine (I). In the U.S., 5% Lugol’s solution can be purchased directly from manufacturers (e.g. JCrowsLLC.com). It can also be made at home, as discussed in another section below.</p>

<p><a href="https://steppingstonesliving.com/the-guide/" title="Supplementing with Iodine Guide | Dr. Stephanie Buist">Dr. Stephanie Buist</a> published a free 23-page PDF "The Guide to Supplementing with Lugol’s Iodine" (2015). It concisely summarizes information (including dosages) that she has found helpful to assist members of online iodine groups.</p>

<p>From the mid 1800s to mid 1900s, iodine was commonly used in Western medicine to treat various diseases. In <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/41697/41697-h/41697-h.htm" title="The Project Gutenberg EBook of Merck’s 1899 Manual, by Merck & Co.">Merck’s 1899 Manual</a> of well-established medications used by American physicians, iodine is listed for many conditions and as the most used substance for tumors. Doses listed for 5% Lugol’s solution are 1–10 minims (equivalent to 7.7–77 mg iodine).</p>

<p>For acute toxicity of molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), the lowest <a href="https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/11400.htm" title="Iodine Material Safety Data Sheet | Fischer Scientific">published</a> lethal dose for a human is oral LD<sub>Lo</sub> 28 mg/kg (per kg of body weight). For acute toxicity of potassium iodine (KI), the lowest <a href="https://www.drugfuture.com/toxic/q102-q501.html" title="Potassium iodide | drugfuture.com">published</a> toxic dose is oral TD<sub>Lo</sub> 2700 mg/kg (human female adult) with reproductive effect during pregnancy.</p>

<p>The Journal of Restorative Medicine published a 2017 <a href="https://journal.restorativemedicine.org/index.php/journal/article/view/112/133" title="Iodine or Iodide? A Laboratory Evaluation of the Content of ­Powdered Iodine Supplements | Journal of Restorative Medicine">study</a> by Dr. Darrow Hand and Dr. Denis Wilson. Chromatography, ion-coupled mass spectrometry, and X-ray spectrometry were used to test three different commercial dry iodine supplements that list both iodine and iodide on the label. They conclude these contain only iodide when consumed. The body easily converts iodide to iodine, unless the mechanisms are impaired (e.g. deficiency in NIS or tissue-specific peroxidases).</p>

<p>Before iodine was isolated in the 1800s, seaweed-based medicine was used for thousands of years. Historically, the Japanese consumed an estimated 5.3–13.8 mg/day iodine in their diet, mostly from seaweed. In her book Lynn Farrow <a href="http://www.breastcancerchoices.org/seaweed.html" title="Contamination - Seaweed is No Longer a Healthy Food | Lynne Farrow">notes</a> that seaweed may now be polluted with toxic heavy metals, oil spill dispersants, radiation, or other industrial contaminants from seawater. In a March 2011 interview, Dr. Brownstein mentions that he had a few different brands of seaweed analyzed by a laboratory. About 50% of the samples had very high levels of toxic mercury and bromide, which can interfere with the body’s ability to use iodine. Also the longer the seaweed has been stored after processing, the more iodine is lost through sublimation into a gaseous state.</p>

<h3 id="60">Homemade Solution</h3>

<p>For an inexpensive source of iodine, I purchased USP (pharmaceutical-grade) potassium iodide powder crystals from CarolinaChemical.com. The product was manufactured by SQM, an established chemical company in Chile which is the largest global producer of iodine.</p>

<p>To measure potassium iodide powder, I used "Norpro mini stainless steel measuring spoons, set of 5 (TAD, DASH, PINCH, SMIDGEN and DROP)" along with a set of high-quality US measuring spoons. The powder was packed into the spoon and leveled off. I observed the following approximate measurements on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale.</p>

<p>For example, to make a potassium iodide solution that I use for oral supplementation, I add a packed leveled 1/4 teaspoon of potassium iodide powder and 1 US cup of purified water into a labeled glass bottle. I tightly seal with cap, shake until the powder is dissolved, and store securely in a dark location. Each 0.5 US teaspoon of the solution contains approximately 18 mg iodine (as iodide).</p>

<p>2200 mg potassium iodide powder × 0.7645 (76.45% iodine by weight) = 1682 mg iodine, ÷ 96 (number of 0.5 US teaspoon in 1 US cup water) = 18 mg</p>

<p id="84">I also make a 20% (weight/volume) concentration of potassium iodide solution to keep on hand for oral supplementation when traveling, nebulization for respiratory symptoms, application for oral health or sore throat, and topical skin treatment for minor bump, mosquito bite, rash, or scrape. I add a packed leveled 1 US teaspoon potassium iodide power and 2 US tablespoons purified water through a funnel into a labeled Aozita 2 oz (60 ml) glass dropper bottle. I tightly seal with cap and store in refridgerator. Each vertical drop contains approximately 9 mg iodine (as iodide).</p>

<p>Calculations: A standard glass dropper dispenses approximately 20 vertical drops/ml. My Aozita glass dropper bottle dispensed 235.0 vertical drops in a 10.0 ml graduated cylinder, the equivalent of 23.5 drops/ml. When I added a packed leveled 1 US teaspoon potassium iodide power (6728 mg iodine, 8800 mg total weight) and 2 US tablespoons purified water (29.6 g) into a 50 ml graduated cylinder, the volume was 33 ml. When added into my Aozita glass dropper bottle, it contained approximately 9 mg iodine/drop (6728 mg iodine ÷ (33 ml × 23.5 drops/ml)), with a concentration of 20% weight/volume (6.728 g iodine ÷ 33 ml) and 17.5% weight/weight (6.728 g iodine ÷ (8.8 g + 29.6 g)).</p>

<p>If desired, molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) could be added to make a Lugol’s solution that contains both iodine and iodide (in ionic state). This <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Lugols-Iodine-10/" title="How to make 10% Lugols Iodine | Instructables.com">site</a> has written instructions for how to make it, along with a video demonstrating a simple method and examples of topical usage.</a> Molecular iodine is also known as diatomic iodine, iodine crystals, prilled iodine, and USP elemental free iodine. Some vendors test to verify low in toxic heavy metals. Use safety precautions when handling.</p>

<h3 id="61">My Experience</h3>

<p>In his book Dr. Brownstein explains that when a person begins taking a high amount of iodine, the body releases toxic halides which may cause a detoxification reaction such as fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and palpitations. Supplemental magnesium, selenium, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and zinc can reduce that potential and assist the body to more efficiently utilize iodine.</p>

<p>While taking those supplements, I gradually increased my daily iodine intake using homemade potassium iodide solutions described above and experienced no adverse effects. I continue to take this long term and have noticed better sleep quality, more energy, and higher testosterone.</p>

<p>I repeatedly applied drops of 20% iodine together with drops of pure DMSO to my skin where I had a small sebaceous cyst, which gradually disappeared without need for excision.</p>

<h2 id="13">Magnesium</h2>

<p>Studies referenced in the following publications have shown that magnesium supplementation can reduce risk of arthritis, asthma, cancer, depression, diabetes, heart disease, inflammation, osteoporosis, stroke, and overall mortality. It may also help <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/supplemental-magnesium-important-vitamin-d-levels/" title="Is supplemental magnesium important for vitamin D levels? | GrassrootsHealth">increase</a> vitamin D levels and <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n05.shtml" title="What Really Causes Kidney Stones | Orthomolecular.org">reduce</a> risk of kidney stone.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.health-science-spirit.com/Healing_the_Body/Magnesium-Chloride.html" title="Magnesium Chloride for Health & Rejuvenation | Walter Last">article</a> by Walter Last describes how magnesium is important for bones, teeth, cellular energy production and repair, enzyme reactions, brain, nervous system, heart, and muscle activity.</p>

<p><a href="https://drcarolyndean.com/" title="Dr. Carolyn Dean | DrCarolynDean.com">Dr. Carolyn Dean</a> has extensively studied therapeutic use of magnesium. In the following article, she suggests magnesium chloride or magnesium citrate to avoid a laxative effect that may occur with other forms of supplemental magnesium.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Carolyn Dean, MD, ND. <a href="http://www.orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v13n22.shtml" title="Magnesium | Orthomolecular.org">MAGNESIUM</a>. Orthomolecular Medicine News Service 2017.</p>

<p>However, I contend that magnesium deficiency is constantly being misdiagnosed as many different diseases, so I am merely suggesting that people treat their magnesium deficiency. Using high doses of magnesium (600–1200 mg elemental magnesium per day) for migraines, high blood pressure, angina, diabetes, high cholesterol, muscle cramps and spasms, nerve tingling and burning, is far less invasive than immediately prescribing drugs. I’ve observed thousands of people using therapeutic doses of a non-laxative form of magnesium with tremendous success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her book further explains the potential benefits of magnesium for a wide variety of conditions, including the importance for brain health:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Carolyn Dean, MD, ND. The Magnesium Miracle (2nd ed., p. 343). Ballantine 2017.</p>

<p>Research indicates that ample magnesium can protect brain cells from the damaging effects of aluminum, beryllium, cadmium, lead, mercury, and nickel. We also know that low levels of brain magnesium contribute to the deposition of heavy metals in the brain that heralds Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. It appears that the metals compete with magnesium for entry into the brain cells. If magnesium is low in the brain, heavy metals gain access much more readily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.peakenergy.com/" title="Dr. Thomas E. Levy | PeakEnergy.com">Dr. Thomas E. Levy</a> also wrote a comprehensive book about magnesium:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD. Magnesium: Reversing Disease (1st ed., p. 29). MedFox 2019.</p>

<p>Since magnesium does most of its work inside the body’s cells, substantial body-wide deficiencies of magnesium are common even in the face of a normal serum magnesium level. And, much more often than not, this “hidden” deficiency remains unaddressed for the lifetime of the patient. As will be demonstrated in subsequent chapters, this unaddressed state of magnesium deficiency is not only the origin of many diseases, it reliably promotes and further aggravates all known diseases.</p>

<h3>Powder Measurement</h3>

<p>Sources of magnesium chloride such as the Dead Sea, Great Salt Lake, and the manufactured form sold by chemical supply houses may contain <a href="https://drsircus.com/magnesium/magnesium-chloride-product-analysis/" title="Magnesium Chloride Product Analysis | Dr. Mark Sircus">significant levels</a> of toxic heavy metals.</p>

<p>One of the cleanest sources of magnesium chloride is the deep underground ancient Zechstein seabed in the Netherlands. Hot water extraction and evaporation are used to produce magnesium chloride hexahydrate crystals/flakes in a purified form, with <a href="http://www.genuinezechstein.com/genuine-zechstein-coa-a101-a901.pdf" title="Certificate of Analysis | Genuine Zechstein">no risk</a> of toxic heavy metals. I purchased the Enviromedica.com Ancient Minerals brand and use an electric grinder (KitchenAid blade coffee and spice grinder combo pack) to reduce the crystals/flakes into fine powder.</p>

<p>To measure magnesium chloride hexahydrate powder, I used a set of high-quality US measuring spoons. The powder was packed into the spoon and leveled off. I observed the following approximate measurements on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale.</p>

<h2 id="35">Niacin</h2>

<p>Studies referenced in the following publications indicate that niacin can improve cardiovascular health by raising good cholesterol (HDL) while reducing total cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol-associated lipoprotein (VLDL), and hardening of arteries. Also reported are potential benefit for allergy, arthritis, attention deficit disorder, blood circulation, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n05.shtml" title="Niacin and Cancer: How vitamin B-3 protects and even helps repair your DNA | Orthomolecular.org">cancer</a>, cataract, DNA repair, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n11.shtml" title="Erectile Dysfunction and Niacin | Orthomolecular.org">erectile dysfunction</a>, immune system, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n25.shtml" title="NIACIN for COVID | Orthomolecular.org">infection</a>, inflammation, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n22.shtml" title="Reversing Chronic Kidney Disease with Niacin and Sodium Bicarbonate | Orthomolecular.org">kidney disease</a>, mental illness, migraine headache, neurological disorder, Raynaud’s phenomenon, skin condition, sleep quality, and toxin removal. Niacin is a precursor for the NAD molecule, required for 400+ different gene functions.</p>

<p>I read that niacin (immediate-release nicotinic acid) has nearly 100% absorption and is the most beneficial, safest type of vitamin B3 in high dosage. Other types of vitamin B3 without a flush sensation have a lower degree of liver safety, especially extended/sustained/time-release niacin. Inositol hexaniacinate has lower absorption and is less effective. Niacinamide has no cardiovascular benefit.</p>

<p>The book "Niacin: The Real Story" (Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD., Harold D. Foster, PhD. 1st ed., p. 124. Basic Health 2012) describes related studies. For example, Dr. Edwin Boyle at NIH followed 160 coronary patients using 3 g/day niacin for 10 years and found that mortality was greatly reduced, 90% below the expected average. His report concludes, "From the strictly medical viewpoint, I believe all patients taking niacin would survive longer and enjoy life much more."</p>

<p>In the early 1950s Dr. Abram Hoffer began research and became a world authority on the therapeutic use of niacin. He founded the <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/" title="Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine | Orthomolecular.org">Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine</a> in 1968 and was editor-in-chief for four decades. He <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/Hoffer2009int.pdf" title="An Interview with Abram Hoffer | Andrew W. Saul">used</a> niacin throughout his 55-year career as a physician to help an estimated 5000 schizophrenic patients with a 90% recovery rate.</p>

<p>He usually started them at 3 g/day niacin in divided doses and noted that tests have shown this to increase liver activity, which is not necessarily a sign of liver pathology. His article <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/hoffer_niacin.html" title="Vitamin B-3: Niacin and Its Amide">Vitamin B-3: Niacin and Its Amide</a> (Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD. Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients. 1995;147:30–39) contains a guideline of 0.5–3 g/day niacin for healthy adults, and 1–10 g/day niacin for various conditions including psychological stress, mental illness, high cholesterol, pregnancy, lactation, and infection such as cold or flu.</p>

<p><a href="http://doctoryourself.com/" title="DoctorYourself.com | Andrew Saul">Andrew W. Saul</a> has been a natural health educator and author for 40+ years. He co-founded the <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/index.shtml" title="Orthomolecular Medicine News Service">Orthomolecular Medicine News Service</a> and has been editor-in-chief since 2005. In an October 2012 <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/InterviewNiacin01.pdf" title="A Special Interview with Andrew W. Saul">interview</a> about vitamin B3, he discusses different forms, safety of dosage, and how it has been successfully used to benefit arthritis, cardiovascular system, mental health, and sleep quality. He usually takes the same amount that Dr. Hoffer personally took, 3–4 g/day niacin with meals.</p>

<p>In a 2019 <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/niacin.html" title="How to Determine a Saturation Level of Niacin | Andrew W. Saul">article</a> about dosage and the flush sensation, Saul suggests starting with very small amounts of niacin and gradually increasing until the first flush is noticed. He notes there are physicians who consider the RDA (renamed Reference Daily Intake) for niacin as too low for optimal health, and that also taking a separate B-complex supplement can be beneficial.</p>

<h3>Powder Measurement</h3>

<p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is much <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n14.shtml" title="The Restoration of Vitamin C Synthesis in Humans | Orthomolecular.org">more</a> than a micronutrient needed in minute quantities. Humans are among the few known species unable to internally synthesize ascorbic acid because of a mutation in the gene encoding for a required liver enzyme. Many animals make this in significant amounts to maintain health. For example, a 150-lb (68-kg) goat produces an estimated 13 g/day ascorbic acid when healthy and up to 100 g/day during illness. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n52.shtml" title="How high-dose ascorbate therapy works on the farm | Orthomolecular.org">Farmers</a> have found that feeding their sick animals high doses of ascorbic acid powder can greatly assist in recovery.</p>

<h3 id="39">Benefit</h3>

<p>Oxidative stress from free radicals contributes to aging and development of disease. Natural compounds with antioxidant properties can protect against this. Vitamin C is an effective water-soluble antioxidant predominant in blood, intracellular fluids, and tissues. It is also used to recycle other antioxidants such as glutathione and vitamin E.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is an important enzyme cofactor for neurotransmitters, hormones, and collagen — one of the main structural components of blood vessels, bone, cartilage, eye lens, heart valves, ligaments, skin, and tendons.</p>

<p>Studies and physician reports referenced in publications mentioned below indicate that high-dose vitamin C can be beneficial for:</p>

<ul class="single-space">
    <li>allergy and asthma (antihistamine)</li>
    <li>blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels</li>
    <li>burn, skin condition, and wound healing</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="40">Toxin & Radiation</h3>

<p>In the book "Curing the Incurable: Vitamin C, Infectious Diseases, and Toxins" (4th ed., p. 168. MedFox 2011), <a href="https://www.peakenergy.com/" title="Dr. Thomas E. Levy | PeakEnergy.com">Dr. Thomas E. Levy</a> remarks, "Vitamin C has demonstrated the ability to neutralize a wide variety of toxic substances, many of which are completely unrelated chemically." High-dose vitamin C has been shown to reduce effects of air pollution, alcohol and food poisoning, chemical exposure, drug toxicity and withdrawal, pesticides, radiation, toxic heavy metals, and venom.</p>

<p>Lead is a toxic heavy metal that can accumulate in the body. Elevated lead levels are common and associated with significantly <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/lead-toxicity-4th-leading-killer/" title="Lead Toxicity 4th Leading Killer | Bill Sardi">increased</a> risk of disease and mortality. High-dose oral vitamin C and crushed raw garlic can assist the body in reducing lead levels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v08n06.shtml" title="Vitamin C Prevents Radiation Damage | Orthomolecular.org">Studies</a> in Japan <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/Radiation_VitC.pptx.pdf" title="Effect of Vitamin C and antioxidative nutrition on radiation-induced gene expression">found</a> that high-dose (oral and IV) vitamin C helped protect Fukushima nuclear plant workers exposed to radiation during the cleanup.</p>

<h3 id="41">Infection</h3>

<p>Vitamin C when taken in frequent high oral doses may reduce cold and flu symptoms. For example, "Orthomolecular Medicine for Everyone: Megavitamin Therapeutics for Families and Physicians" (Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 85. Basic Health 2008) mentions a study where 252 people took 3 g/day vitamin C when healthy and 1 g/hour for six hours at onset of symptoms, which decreased by 85% compared to the control group of 463 people.</p>

<p>Dr. Suzanne Humphries wrote a <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v14n13.shtml" title="Sodium Ascorbate Treatment of Whooping Cough | Orthomolecular.org">guide</a> about high-dose oral vitamin C for infants and children with whooping cough. She comments, "I’ve received hundreds of letters of appreciation telling me how the protocol worked for parents using it on their own."</p>

<p>Studies have shown IV vitamin C to lower mortality for hospitalized patients with life-threatening conditions such as <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24484547" title="Phase I safety trial of intravenous ascorbic acid in patients with severe sepsis | Europe PMC">sepsis</a> or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6466264/" title="Effect of ascorbic acid in the treatment of tetanus | PubMed">tetanus</a>. It <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n25.shtml" title="Vitamin C Evidence for Treating Complications of COVID-19 and other Viral Infections | Orthomolecular.org">has</a> also been <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n28.shtml" title="Vitamin C and Coronavirus: Not a Vaccine; Just a Humble Cure | Orthomolecular.org">used</a> throughout the world to significantly <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n50.shtml" title="Vitamin C Cuts COVID Deaths by Two-Thirds | Orthomolecular.org">reduce</a> mortality from viral infection. In China it proved so effective that 50,000 kg of vitamin C was sent to the epicenter of an epidemic in Wuhan to assist in recovery.</p>

<p>I came across numerous reports on the use of high-dose vitamin C during remarkable healing from infection. For example, the book "Vitamin C: The Real Story" (Steve Hickey, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 117. Basic Health 2015) relates how a man successfully used up to 250 g/day oral vitamin C when he began to develop Legionnaires’ disease as confirmed by lab testing. He had recently stayed at a hotel where three other people caught the same disease and died within a few days at different hospitals.</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas E. Levy notes in "Primal Panacea" (1st ed., p. 15. MedFox 2011), "After over 15 years of research and personal observation, I can categorically say that high-dose vitamin C is a clinical miracle when compared to all of our modern drugs. Furthermore, volumes of studies exist that say it works." He describes how physicians recommended removing life support from a swine flu patient who had been comatose for the prior month. With assistance of family, the patient then began receiving high-dose IV vitamin C and fully recovered.</p>

<p>The book also recounts the story of a patient who was hospitalized for several weeks with bone infection of the hand. It became so severe that physicians recommended amputation to save his life. Instead the patient then began high-dose (oral and IV) vitamin C. His hand quickly healed, with the infection and swelling gone after nine days.</p>

<h3 id="42">Diabetes</h3>

<p>Two <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/news-and-media-releases/articles/humble-vitamin-c-tablet-key-to-deakin-diabetes-breakthrough" title="Humble vitamin C tablet key to Deakin diabetes breakthrough">studies</a> from Deakin University in Australia found that oral vitamin C supplementation improved insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes. They took 500 mg ascorbic acid twice daily for four months. Reported benefits include a 36% drop in blood sugar spike after meals, nearly three hours per day less hyperglycaemia, and 50% reduction in hypertension.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Glenn Wadley notes, "Vitamin C’s antioxidant properties can help counteract the high levels of free radicals found in people with diabetes, and it’s encouraging to see this benefits a number of the disease’s common comorbidities, such as high blood pressure."</p>

<h3 id="43">Cancer</h3>

<p>Steve Hickey and other researchers have <a href="http://drpasswater.com/nutrition_library/hickey.html" title="The Science of Vitamin C and Cancer | Richard A. Passwater">described</a> evidence that high-dose (oral and IV) vitamin C can generate hydrogen peroxide inside cancer cells to destroy them, while leaving healthy cells unharmed. Taking frequent high oral doses of both ascorbic acid powder and liposomal vitamin C provides much higher blood levels <a href="https://wholefoodsmagazine.com/columns/vitamin-connection/the-science-of-vitamin-c-research-on-optimizing-blood-and-cellular-levels/" title="The Science of Vitamin C Research on Optimizing Blood and Cellular Levels | Richard A.

<p><a href="http://doctoryourself.com/Hoffer2009int.pdf" title="An Interview with Abram Hoffer | Andrew W. Saul">An Interview with Abram Hoffer</a> (Andrew W. Saul, PhD. J Orthomol Med 2009;24(3):1–8) mentions that Dr. Abram Hoffer used high-dose oral vitamin C with 1600+ cancer patients. At least 40% reached 10 year cure rates. In "Orthomolecular Treatment of Chronic Disease: 65 Experts on Therapeutic and Preventive Nutrition" (Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 238. Basic Health 2014), Dr. Hoffer describes using 40 g/day oral vitamin C with a pancreatic cancer patient that other physicians considered terminal and untreatable. The patient made a full recovery and lived another 20 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://orthomolecular.org/hof/2005/hriordan.html" title="Dr. Hugh Riordan | Orthomolecular.org">Dr. Hugh Riordan</a> was the first to demonstrate that high-dose IV vitamin C is chemotherapeutic for cancer patients. He founded the <a href="https://riordanclinic.org/" title="Riordan Clinic">Riordan Clinic</a> which specializes in functional and integrative medicine.</p>

<p>Dr. Raymond CF Yuen in Singapore has researched the clinical application of high-dose IV vitamin C (HDIVC) for cancer immunotherapy. In a 2021 <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n20.shtml" title="High Dose Vitamin C for Cancer | Orthomolecular.org">article</a> he notes, "In the ten years that I have been administering HDIVC for cancer patients, I have always found it effective in improving patients’ quality of life and survival. I have seen stage 4 cancer patients who were given a poor prognosis survive longer than their oncologists’ prediction or expectation."
</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Breslin in New Mexico successfully <a href="https://omarchives.org/video-cathcart/#11" title="Dr Robert Cathcart MD Video Transcripts | OMArchives.org">treated</a> cancer patients with 120–180 g/day IV vitamin C in a continuous drip from a chemotherapy pump and catheter.</p>

<p>Physicians have <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v03n12.shtml" title="Topical Vitamin C Stops Basal Cell Carcinoma | Orthomolecular.org">used</a> high-concentration vitamin C applied topically for various skin conditions, including the removal of basal cell carcinoma.</a>

<h3 id="44">Formulation</h3>

<p>Ascorbic acid is the type of vitamin C that animals internally synthesize. It has two extra electrons per molecule to donate to oxidized free radicals and neutralize their harmful effects in the body.</p>

<p>Powder can be economical for high oral dosage, with no added fillers found in tablets. Powder readily dissolves in water and use of a straw can keep it off teeth. It’s best to consume a vitamin C solution before it eventually turns yellow-brown due to oxidation from exposure to air, heat, or light. Refridgeration will slow that process.</p>

<p>Studies found that small amounts of plant pigments (flavonoids) in vitamin C products marketed as "natural" are not significant and not more effective than pure ascorbic acid. Studies found that slow timed-release capsules are not more efficient in increasing vitamin C levels, compared to other oral forms.</p>

<p>Mineral ascorbates are another type of vitamin C. Calcium ascorbate (Ester-C) contains 10% calcium, and sodium ascorbate contains 13% sodium. Excessive amounts of these minerals may not be appropriate when taken orally in high dosage. Mineral ascorbates are less potent as an antioxidant with only one extra electron per molecule to donate.</p>

<p>Ascorbyl palmitate contains 42.5% vitamin C and is not more bioavailable than pure ascorbic acid. When ascorbyl palmitate is taken orally, the small intestine releases the ascorbic acid molecule that is bound to the ester.</p>

<p id="49">Most forms of oral vitamin C require active transport in the bowel for absorption. Liposomal vitamin C is a less common, more expensive form absorbed by a different mechanism in gut cells. A liposome has a spherical phospholipid bilayer, with an internal cavity capable of carrying liquid vitamin C such as ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate. Absorption can be up to 90% of a high oral dose, depending on how the liposome encapsulation is formulated.</p>

<p>In two 2018 <a href="https://www.peakenergy.com/interviews/passwater1/are-liposome-encapsulated-vitamin-c-and-or-the-levy-multi-c-protocol-more-effective-than-intravenous-vitamin-c/" title="Part 1 Interview: Are Liposome-encapsulated Vitamin C… | PeakEnergy.com">interview</a> <a href="https://www.peakenergy.com/interviews/passwater2/are-liposome-encapsulated-vitamin-c-and-or-the-levy-multi-c-protocol-more-effective-than-intravenous-vitamin-c-part2/" title="Part 2 Interview: Are Liposome-encapsulated Vitamin C… | PeakEnergy.com">articles</a>, Dr. Thomas E. Levy indicates that oral use of liposomal vitamin C during viral infection can quickly load vitamin C into immune cells in the lymphatics of the gut. He personally notes that when using liposomal vitamin C, "I ended up overcoming a severe cold/flu more quickly than I ever had before, even when I had access to multiple 50- to 100-gram infusions of vitamin C intravenously." After receiving similar feedback from patients and healthcare practitioners, he became a consultant to LivOn Labs. He mentions that many other brands advertising liposomes do not contain such.</p>

<h3 id="63">Powder Measurement</h3>

<p>To measure ascorbic acid powder, I used "Norpro mini stainless steel measuring spoons, set of 5 (TAD, DASH, PINCH, SMIDGEN and DROP)" along with a set of high-quality US measuring spoons. The range depended on whether the powder was lightly scooped or firmly packed down into the spoon, before being leveled off. I observed the following approximate measurements on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale.</p>

<h3 id="45">Dosage</h3>

<p>The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) published a Reference Daily Intake (previously RDA) of 90 mg/day vitamin C for adults to prevent scurvy, a life-threatening illness that quickly results from severe deficiency. This dosage is not intended for prevention of chronic diseases. Based on case reports, they published a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 2 g/day vitamin C for which almost no adults will experience loose stools. However, much higher dosages are suggested by physicians and researchers experienced with the use of high-dose vitamin C for optimal health and healing.</p>

<p>In the early 1940s, medical pioneer Dr. Frederick R. Klenner began reporting on successful therapeutic use of high-dose (oral, intramuscular, intravenous, and topical) vitamin C for various conditions including allergy, arthritis, burns, corneal ulcer, diabetes, glaucoma, heat stroke, high cholesterol, infections, mental illness, multiple sclerosis, post-surgery, pregnancy, and toxins. During a 1948 epidemic, all 60 of his polio patients had no residual damage from the acute viral disease known to produce permanent deformities.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/198x/smith-lh-clinical_guide_1988.htm" title="Clinical Guide to the Use of Vitamin C | Dr. Klenner">report</a> Dr. Klenner remarks, "I have never seen a patient that Vitamin C would not benefit." He <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/klennerpaper.html" title="1971 Dr. Klenner Vitamin C Paper">suggests</a> these oral dosages of ascorbic acid in divided doses when healthy: (1) infants begin with 50 mg/day and gradually increase to 1 g/day by age one; (2) children under age ten at least 1 g/day for each year of life; and (3) adults at least 10 g/day. He mentions personally taking 10–20 g/day vitamin C when healthy.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1969, Dr. Robert F. Cathcart III used high-dose vitamin C to help over 30,000 patients throughout his career. He found ascorbic acid to be the most effective type of oral vitamin C. In a 26-minute <a href="https://rumble.com/vh7mlv-vitamin-c-dr.-robert-f.-cathcart-iii.html" title="Vitamin C - Dr. Robert F. Cathcart III | Rumble.com">presentation</a> he describes various therapeutic uses, including how it eliminated his chronic allergies and greatly reduced his frequent colds. He mentions personally taking 16 g/day ascorbic acid when healthy.</p>

<p>Dr. Cathcart notes that at least 80% of healthy adults can tolerate 10–15 g/day ascorbic acid powder dissolved in water in 4–6 divided oral doses. In a <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/cathcart_thirdface.html" title="The Third Face of Vitamin C | Dr. Cathcart">report </a> he explains, "Bowel tolerance doses are the amounts of ascorbic acid tolerated orally that almost, but not quite, cause diarrhea." In another <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/titration.html" title="How to Determine a Therapeutic Dose of Vitamin C | Dr. Cathcart">report</a> he details how bowel tolerance can significantly increase depending on severity of illness, allowing oral dosages of 15 to 200+ g/day without diarrhea. To be effective in recovery, dosage needs to be near bowel tolerance and taken frequently until feeling completely well.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://omarchives.org/video-cathcart/" title="Dr Robert Cathcart MD Video Transcripts | OMArchives.org">interview</a> Dr. Cathcart suggests adult oral dosages for acute illness, starting with 2–6 g ascorbic acid every 15 minutes, with amount increased until diarrhea, then continued at a slightly reduced amount that does not cause diarrhea. As symptoms decrease, so can bowel tolerance with dosage reduced as needed. Reducing carbohydrate intake can also improve absorption of vitamin C during illness, along with drinking plenty of water.</p>

<p>For healthy adults, the half-life of high-dose oral vitamin C in the bloodstream is estimated to be 30–120 minutes. Use of divided doses spread throughout the day allows a much higher percentage to be absorbed.</p>

<p>In "Curing the Incurable" (4th ed., p. 331. MedFox 2011), Dr. Thomas E. Levy suggests 6–12 g/day oral vitamin C in 3–4 divided doses for healthy adults, with optimal dosages usually closer to 12 g than 6 g.</p>

<p>In "How To Live Longer and Feel Better" (1st ed., p. 8. Avon 1986), renowned scientist <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/hof/2004/lpauling.html" title="Linus Pauling | Orthomolecular.org">Linus Pauling</a> suggests 6–18 g/day oral vitamin C for healthy adults. He researched vitamin C for 25 years, and in later interviews mentions personally taking 18 g/day ascorbic acid when healthy.</p>

<p>In "Vitamin C: The Real Story" (Steve Hickey, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 62. Basic Health 2015), the authors suggest at least 2–3 g/day oral vitamin C in divided doses for healthy adults, with optimal dosages likely much higher at 50–90% of bowel tolerance. They suggest occasional retesting since it may change with time. In a 2009 <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/Hoffer2009int.pdf" title="An Interview with Abram Hoffer | Andrew W. Saul">interview</a> Andrew W. Saul mentions personally taking 18 g/day ascorbic acid, and in a 2018 <a href="https://wholefoodsmagazine.com/columns/vitamin-connection/the-science-of-vitamin-c-research-on-optimizing-blood-and-cellular-levels/" title="The Science of Vitamin C Research on Optimizing Blood and Cellular Levels | Richard A.

<h3 id="46">Safety</h3>

<p>In this section, all use of the term vitamin C refers to ascorbic acid, the type that animals internally synthesize. Vitamin C is a nontoxic, water-soluble substance that does not accumulate in the body. Since the 1940s physicians have reported a high degree of safety with the use of high-dose oral vitamin C. Potential side effects are temporary gastrointestinal disturbances which quickly subside when dosage is reduced.</p>

<p>There is no compelling, consistent data that indicate any serious adverse effects from high-dose oral vitamin C. No clinical trials have ever shown this to increase any risk factors in healthy people.</p>

<p>Physicians and researchers experienced with the use of high-dose vitamin C <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v06n24.shtml" title="About Objections to Vitamin C Therapy | Orthomolecular.org">confirm</a> that it does not cause B12 deficiency, birth defect, cataract, DNA damage, infertility, kidney stone, low blood sugar, or miscarriage. The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1179/135100001101535978" title="The New U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamins C and E | Redox Report">reports</a> "the in vivo data do not clearly show a causal relationship between excess vitamin C intake" and allergic response, excess iron absorption, kidney stone formation, pro-oxidant effects, reduced vitamin B12 and copper levels, systemic conditioning or rebound scurvy.</p>

<p>Observational studies are highly variable in quality of evidence provided, potential bias, and errors. Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables may be incorrect based on an observed association between them — correlation does not imply causation. For example, people with a medical condition may be found to more frequently take a nutritional supplement to improve their health, and that does not imply that the supplement caused the medical condition.</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n06.shtml" title="Cataracts and Vitamins: The Real Story | Orthomolecular.org">Cataracts and Vitamins: The Real Story</a> (Orthomolecular.org 2013) addresses an observational study that found an association between cataract and oral vitamin C, with the incorrect implication that the vitamin C caused the cataract. It is not scientifically plausible. The study contradicts many other studies that have shown long-term benefit (e.g. 80% reduction in cataract) or short-term no effect.</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n05.shtml" title="What Really Causes Kidney Stones (And Why Vitamin C Does Not) | Orthomolecular.org">What Really Causes Kidney Stones (And Why Vitamin C Does Not)</a> (Orthomolecular.org 2013) addresses an observational study that found an association between kidney stone and oral vitamin C, with the incorrect implication that the vitamin C caused the kidney stone. Professor Emanuel Cheraskin states, "Vitamin C in the urine tends to bind calcium and decrease its free form. This means less chance of calcium’s separating out as calcium oxalate (stones)." Important factors in development of kidney stone are dehydration and high dietary intake of oxalate sources such as spinach, coffee, and tea.</p>

<p>The article <a href="https://www.patrickholford.com/blog/kidney-stones-caused-by-vitamin-c" title="Kidney stones caused by vitamin C? | Patrick Holford">Kidney stones caused by vitamin C?</a> (PatrickHolford.com 2013) describes a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9589801/" title="The effect of ascorbic acid ingestion on the biochemical… | PubMed">study</a> at the Kidney Stone Research Laboratory at University of Cape Town. Unlike other erroneous studies, for this study they used collection containers with a preservative to keep urine from changing while being stored before testing. Ten subjects took 4 g/day oral vitamin C for five days and laboratory urinalysis found no increased risk factors. A world expert in this field, Professor Allen Rodgers indicated that kidney stone could not be caused by use of vitamin C.</p>

<p>A 1994 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8126804/" title="Effect of high dose vitamin C on urinary oxalate levels | PubMed">study</a> published in The Journal of Urology had similar findings. The researchers tested subjects with oral dosages of up to 10 g/day vitamin C for several days and conclude, "no genuine increase in urinary oxalate was demonstrable despite a greatly increased ascorbate intake."</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v01n07.shtml" title="Vitamin C Does Not Cause Kidney Stones | Orthomolecular.org">Vitamin C Does Not Cause Kidney Stones</a> (Orthomolecular.org 2005) mentions a study of 45,251 men that found those taking above 1.5 g/day vitamin C had reduced risk of kidney stone. A follow-up study of 85,557 women for 14 years found the risk was the same for people taking under 250 mg/day and those taking 1.5 g/day. The authors of these large studies state that restricting high-dose vitamin C for potential kidney stone is unwarranted.</p>

<p>Beginning in the 1940s, <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/mccormick.html" title="Megadose Vitamin C: Dr. William J. McCormick">Dr. William J. McCormick</a> and Dr. Frederick R. Klenner reported that long-term use of high-dose oral vitamin C does not cause kidney stone in healthy adults, and can be protective.</p>

<p>Toward the end of his career, Dr. Robert F. Cathcart III <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/kidney.html" title="Kidney Stones (Renal Calculi) and Their Relation to Diet">reported</a> that he had put an estimated 25,000 patients on high-dose oral vitamin C and none developed kidney stone as a result. Two patients not using a high dosage developed kidney stone; he advised them to use a high dosage and they had no further problems.</p>

<p>The book "Ascorbate: The Science of Vitamin C" (Steve Hickey, PhD., Hilary Roberts, PhD. 1st ed., p. 95. Lulu 2004) mentions that throughout his career, Dr. Cathcart never saw high-dose oral vitamin C cause any adverse effects involving G6P6 deficiency, a rare genetic mutation in people of African or Middle Eastern descent. He treated two patients with hemochromatosis and both were able to safely use high-dose oral vitamin C with no adverse effects. Hemochromatosis is excess accumulation of iron in the body, usually caused by an inherited condition.</p>

<h3 id="51">My Experience</h3>

<p>When healthy I comfortably take up to 16.5 g/day ascorbic acid powder in water drank throughout the day. After taking that along with 3 g/day lysine for several months, my vision at close distances noticeably improved.</p>

<p>I have also taken 2.75–5.5 g ascorbic acid every 15 minutes at onset of flu symptoms which quickly resolved.</p>

<h2 id="17">Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is important for cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, and skeletal systems. <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/association-vitamin-d-inflammation-24-diseases/" title="Association between Vitamin D and Inflammation in 24 Diseases | GrassrootsHealth">Studies</a> indicate <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n21.shtml" title="Update on the beneficial effects of vitamin D | Orthomolecular.org">that</a> supplemental vitamin D can reduce susceptibility or severity of asthma, arthritis, breast and colorectal cancer, depression, diabetes, gout, heart attack, influenza, kidney stone, obesity, and thyroid problem.</p>

<p>Numerous <a href="https://c19vitamind.com/" title="Vitamin D for COVID-19: real-time analysis | C19VitaminD.com">studies</a> have <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v19n07.shtml" title="Top Vitamin D Papers for 2022 | Orthomolecular.org">found</a> vitamin D to be beneficial against viral infection.</p>

<blockquote>

GrassrootsHealth.net 2020.</p>

<p>The evidence connecting vitamin D and COVID-19 disease and severity is overwhelming. Studies have been published concluding that higher vitamin D levels are associated with more positive outcomes, from a decreased risk of testing positive to COVID-19 to a decreased risk of severity and death. In our last post, we shared a short video showing that 70–80% of COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D required admission to the ICU.</p>

<p>GrassrootsHealth has been actively involved for many years in research about vitamin D. They offer helpful <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/project/top-blogs-answer-common-questions/" title="Top Blogs to Answer Common Questions | GrassrootsHealth">information</a> and the opportunity to participate in their research <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/project/projects/" title="Projects | GrassrootsHealth">projects</a> using a home blood spot test, which is mailed in for them to provide the results. According to <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/research/" title="Research | GrassrootsHealth">studies</a> by their panel of 48 vitamin D researchers, a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 40 ng/ml (100 nmol/L) is the lower edge of optimal, with 60–80 ng/ml (150–200 nmol/L) considered ideal for health and disease prevention.</p>

<p>They <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/taking-4000-iu-vitamin-d-per-day-much/" title="Is Taking More than 4,000 IU Vitamin D Per Day Too Much? | GrassrootsHealth">explain</a> how the RDA (renamed Reference Daily Intake) for vitamin D was off by an order of magnitude, and taking at least 4000 IU/day (100 mcg/day) is considered safe for adults. The following article includes a graph showing dosages and resulting vitamin D levels in test participants, with data adjusted for 150-lb (68-kg) body weight.</p>

<p>Whether considering the extremely low recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D as set by the National Academy of Medicine (previously the IOM) or a general suggestion of intake, such as 4,000 IU per day, it is impossible to know how much might be “right” for one person to the next. In fact, a GrassrootsHealth analysis showed that among all adult participants taking an average of 4,000 IU vitamin D per day from supplements, approximately 25% were still below the recommended 40–60 ng/ml.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Studies have shown that taking vitamin D with dietary fat can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25441954/" title="Dietary fat increases vitamin D-3 absorption | PubMed">increase</a> absorption. Vitamin D levels may also be <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/supplemental-magnesium-important-vitamin-d-levels/" title="Is supplemental magnesium important for vitamin D levels? | GrassrootsHealth">improved</a> with supplemental magnesium. A vitamin D researcher since the late 1970s, Bruce Hollis personally found he could not exceed a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 50 ng/ml while taking 10,000 IU/day vitamin D without magnesium supplementation. Then he began taking 400 mg/day magnesium and found he could attain 60 ng/ml by taking 6000 IU/day vitamin D.</p>

<p>I read that taking over 10,000 IU/day vitamin D is generally not considered an appropriate long-term dosage for most adults. However, a physician may order a short-term dosage over 10,000 IU/day vitamin D to rapidly achieve a therapeutic concentration for a patient with vitamin D deficiency or illness. Dr. David Brownstein’s short-term <a href="https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_cc5004cfa84a46d3b1a0338d4308c42c.pdf" title="A Novel Approach to Treating COVID-19 Using Nutritional and Oxidative Therapies | Dr. David Brownstein">regimen</a> for viral infection includes an adult dosage of 5000 IU vitamin D every hour, up to 50,000 IU/day (not during pregnancy). Dr. Richard Z. Cheng has included 50,000 IU/day vitamin D for 5–7 days in his COVID-19 treatment <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2023/01/08/safety-of-high-dose-vit-c-d-etc-in-covid-management/" title="Safety of High Dose Vit C, D etc in Covid Management | DrWlC.com">protocol</a> for patients.</p>

<h2 id="36">Vitamin E</h2>

<p>I read that the natural form of vitamin E (d-alpha tocopherol plus mixed tocopherols) derived from vegetable oil is far more effective than the synthetic form (dl-alpha tocopheryl) made from coal tar.</p>

<p>Vitamin E is an antioxidant important for cardiovascular health, cellular repair, immune system, and vision. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v07n11.shtml" title="Vitamin E Attacked Again | Orthomolecular.org">Studies</a> indicate that high-dose vitamin E may help reduce overall mortality in elderly and prevent ALS, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart attack, and lung cancer. Also reported are potential benefit for Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, epileptic seizures in children, fatty liver disease, and prostate cancer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pioneer vitamin E researchers and clinicians Drs. Wilfrid and Evan Shute treated some 30,000 patients over several decades and found that people in average health received maximum benefit from 800 IU of the d-alpha tocopherol form of vitamin E. Vitamin E has been proven effective in the prevention and treatment of many heart conditions. "The complete or nearly complete prevention of angina attacks is the usual and expected result of treatment with alpha tocopherol" according to Wilfrid Shute, M. D., a cardiologist. Shute prescribed up to 1,600 IU of vitamin E daily and successfully treated patients for acute coronary thrombosis, acute rheumatic fever, chronic rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, diabetes mellitus, acute and chronic nephritis, and even burns, plastic surgery and mazoplasia.</p>

<h2 id="18">Zinc</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zinc-supplements" title="What Are Zinc Supplements Good For? Benefits and More | Healthline">Studies</a> found that zinc is important for immune system, insulin function, neurotransmission, regulation of gene expression, reproduction, and vision. Deficiency is common among some populations. Vegetarians may require as much as 50% more of the Reference Daily Intake (previously RDA) of 11 mg/day zinc for adults. Phytates in whole grains and legumes can bind zinc reducing absorption. To avoid this, I take supplemental zinc on an empty stomach or with fruit. Some may find consuming zinc with food necessary to avoid nausea.</p>

<p>I consume copper in sufficient amounts from foods and stay below the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 40 mg/day zinc, determined unlikely to cause any adverse effects for healthy adults in long-term use. Studies indicate that taking 50–180 mg/day zinc for 1–2 weeks does not result in serious side effects, but taking those dosages long term may result in copper deficiency unless copper is also supplemented.</p>

<p>In 2009 the European Food Safety Authority published the scientific opinion of 21 panel members on the use of zinc picolinate as a supplement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from F. Aguilar, U.R. Charrondiere, et al. <a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1113" title="Chromium picolinate, zinc picolinate and zinc picolinate dihydrate… | Wiley">Chromium picolinate, zinc picolinate and zinc picolinate dihydrate added for nutritional purposes in food supplements</a>. The EFSA Journal 2009;1113:1–41.</p>

<p>The majority of studies reveal a slightly greater bioavailability of zinc from zinc picolinate than from other zinc compounds, although some studies showed similar levels of absorption, and a few investigators claim a somewhat lower absorption of zinc from zinc picolinate than from other zinc compounds.</p>

<p>Based on the available, albeit limited toxicological database, the Panel concluded that at the anticipated use and use levels of zinc picolinate and zinc picolinate dihydrate, as a source of zinc, when added for nutritional purposes in food supplements, are not of safety concern as long as the UL for zinc is not exceeded.</p>

<p>Chlorine dioxide in low concentration is used by industry to purify drinking water and preserve food. When prepared with high-purity reactants, it has not been found to be carcinogenic or mutagenic. Chlorine dioxide in gaseous state can irritate the lungs if breathed in high concentration. In scientific literature there is no documented case of chlorine dioxide poisoning causing fatality during the past 100 years. Chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) made from sodium chlorite (NaClO<sub>2</sub>) should not be confused with a much different chemical — sodium <strong>hypo</strong>chlorite (NaClO) sold as bleach is almost 300 times more toxic.</p>

<p>Physicians have found that chlorine dioxide solution (CDS) in therapeutic dosage is nontoxic and have effectively used it with millions of patients for prevention and treatment of viral infection and other conditions. A day’s worth of chlorine dioxide treatment for one patient can be made for less than 0.01 U.S. dollar. Since this could reduce pharmaceutical industry revenues (1.27 trillion U.S. dollars in 2020), authorities and corporate media have attempted to suppress the treatment by smearing advocates and censoring reports such as the following.</p>

She helped CDS become an official COVID-19 treatment by law in Bolivia. CDS was produced for the public at seven universities, three of which further researched its use for COVID-19. Among patients taking CDS, she observed recovery from autism, cancer, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. Two years ago she worked with a biochemist to investigate CDS and all evidence indicated it is nontoxic in therapeutic dosage. She then began regularly taking CDS (Protocol C) and within three weeks, she healed from oral lesions that had frequently recurred throughout her life, despite trying many medications. For the past two years her condition has not returned.</p>

<p><a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/" title="AndreasKalcker.com">Andreas Kalcker</a> is an advocate of CDS, typically made over a period of hours with chlorine dioxide generated in gaseous state to dissolve in water. He has researched medical use of chlorine dioxide since 2007, developed technology for CDS, worked with health professionals worldwide, and assisted countries during COVID-19. His website offers clinical evidence, protocols, precautions, training, and testimonials about the treatment. The following book contains similar information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Andreas Kalcker. Forbidden Health: Incurable Was Yesterday (1st ed., pp. 19–20). Voedia 2018.</p>

<p>Chlorine dioxide doesn’t only provide oxygen; the chlorine ion is an effective oxidant in the fight against bacteria, viruses, fungus, and parasites. This unique combination is also highly soluble in water, dissolving even better than blood, which is much thicker. Its solubility enables it to deliver oxygen to places in the body not usually reached, like cartilage, amniotic liquids or mucous membranes. We have even witnessed how it seemed able, in many “spontaneous remission” cases, to penetrate the deeper parts of the body, eliminating pathogens and allowing total recovery from rheumatoid arthritis, as in my case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chlorine dioxide through its oxidation-reduction potential can eliminate acidic pathogens and cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unharmed. It also provides oxygen to bodily fluids and interstitial tissues, activating mitochondria to generate more energy for recovery from disease.</p>

<p>When ingested in low concentration, chlorine dioxide is fully absorbed in the stomach within 15 minutes and lasts for two hours in the body. It is more effective in divided doses taken at least 30 minutes before/after a meal, and at least two hours before/after consuming bicarbonate or antioxidants such as vitamin C, coffee, and tea.</p>

<p>The book describes how chlorine dioxide in low concentration has been successfully used by physicians for ALS (Dr. Gustavo León), brucellosis (Dr. Mario Bruseghini), cystic fibrosis (Dr. Camino G.), gonorrhea and HIV/AIDS (Dr. Klaus Schustereder), lung cancer (Dr. Conchi G.E), malaria (Dr. Jan Beute), and vesicular stomatitis (Dr. Eva Serra).</p>

<p>Included are patient testimonials of use in recovery from various conditions such as abscess, allergy, arthritis, asthma, autism, autoimmune disease (lupus), bronchitis, cancer, Candida, cardiovascular disease, Crohn’s disease, cyst, cystic fibrosis, dementia, fibromyalgia, gout, gum disease, heavy metal toxicity, herpes, hypertension, kidney stone, inflammation, Lyme disease, meningitis, migraine headache, neurological disorder, parasites, pneumonia, poisoning, prostatitis, skin problem (acne, bite, burn, psoriasis, rash, wart, wound), thyroid disorder, tuberculosis, type 2 diabetes, typhoid, and ulcer.</p>

<p class="padded"><a href="https://jimhumble.co/important-facts-regarding-mms" title="Important Facts Regarding MMS | Jim Humble">Jim Humble</a> is an advocate of CD/MMS (master mineral solution), another method of making chlorine dioxide. Typically drops of sodium chlorite solution are mixed with drops of mild acid solution for 30 seconds, then diluted with water and immediately consumed. After finding chlorine dioxide effective for malaria in 1996, he worked with health professionals and missionaries throughout the world to develop CD/MMS protocols for a wide variety of conditions, including <a href="#91" title="Another section">heart attack and stroke</a>. In his experience, CD/MMS is somewhat more potent than CDS. He has taught and helped many people, both in person and through his publications.</p>

<p>Excerpt from Jim Humble, Cari Lloyd. MMS Health Recovery Guidebook (1st ed., p. 2). 2016.</p>

<p>The health recovery procedures given in this book are the result of 20 years of teaching people how to use MMS to recover their health. Scores of people worldwide have used and applied the principles outlined in my first books, or taught in seminars. As a result, over the years I have received a great deal of feedback, much of which has contributed to this book. The successes, even in the beginning, were far beyond anything I had ever heard of. However, what we have achieved along the way has helped us arrive at something so fantastic that very few can believe it at first, but those who try it soon discover it for themselves.</p>

On the first day adults begin with 1 drop CD/MMS mixed for 60 seconds and then added to 16 ounces water in a tightly sealed glass bottle (no metal), with 1 ounce drank every 45 minutes throughout the day for 16 doses total. On each subsequent day, the amount added to 16 ounces water is increased by 1 drop CD/MMS. This continues until the dosage is no longer well tolerated. At that point they stop increasing and have reached their optimal dosage to continue for recovery. Some find this to be 50–70 drops/day. Her testing showed the concentration can last up to 72 hours when stored at cool temperature tightly sealed. In her experience, CD/MMS is somewhat more potent than CDS. She has never seen chlorine dioxide harm anyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from The Universal Antidote Interactive Reference Guidebook (p. 20). TheUniversalAntidote.com 2021.</p>

<p>To exemplify just how safe chlorine dioxide is, the pharmaceutical company, Frontier Pharmaceuticals, has produced a variety of FDA approved safe products containing chlorine dioxide that include oral rinse and skin care products, and the founder of the company, Howard Alliger, even has a patent for using chlorine dioxide to eliminate cancer. The patent states the following: "Chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a strong oxidant, can safely be injected into a subject’s body, including a tumor, although the compound has not yet been utilized as a cancer treatment in this manner."</p>

<p>It goes on to say, "ClO2 is highly penetrating, and generally considered nontoxic—as demonstrated by its application in deep wounds, 3rd degree burns, and use in oral and topical diseases."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="54">Ingredients</h3>

<p>Chlorine dioxide is simple and inexpensive to make at home.</p>

<p>I bought 500 g of sodium chlorite (80% flakes, tech grade, made in USA, certified facility) from StellarChemicalCorp.com. I found 31.45% hydrochloric acid (also known as muriatic acid) solution at a hardware store and citric acid crystals at a food retailer. Only one of these acids is needed and either is fine for making CDS. I read that hydrochloric acid is preferable for making CD/MMS — citric acid could be used but may cause gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>

<p>I add the following ingredients through a funnel into labeled Aozita 2 oz (60 ml) glass dropper bottles. Hot water and shaking will dissolve the solids quicker. Once completed, I store the solutions in a cool dark place such as refridgerator.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<p>24% sodium chlorite solution =<br />15 g sodium chlorite 80% flakes (packed leveled 1 US tablespoon) +<br />35 ml purified water (2 US tablespoons and 1 US teaspoon)</p>

<p>Concentration: 15 g NaClO<sub>2</sub> 80% flakes × 0.80 = 12 g pure NaClO<sub>2</sub>, ÷ 50 g total weight (15 g NaClO<sub>2</sub> 80% flakes + 35 g water), × 100 = 24% (weight/weight)</p>

<p>Total volume: 50 g total weight ÷ 1.269 g/ml density per oxy.com = 39 ml</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<p>4% hydrochloric acid solution =<br />5 ml of 31.45% hydrochloric acid solution (1 US teaspoon) +<br />35 ml purified water (2 US tablespoons and 1 US teaspoon)</p>

<p>Concentration: 31.45% HCl initial × 5 ml volume = 3.93% HCl diluted × 40 ml volume. Round 3.93% to 4%.</p>

<p>Total volume: 40 ml</p>

<p>I use protective clothing, eyewear, and gloves in a well-ventilated area to avoid chemical burn. To avoid a splatter reaction, first I add 35 ml water into the dropper bottle and next add the acid.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<p>50% citric acid solution =<br />20 g citric acid crystals (packed leveled 1 US tablespoon and 2 US teaspoons) +<br />20 ml purified water (1 US tablespoon and 1 US teaspoon)</p>

<p>Concentration: 20 g citric acid ÷ 40 g total weight (20 g citric acid + 20 g water), × 100 = 50% (weight/weight)</p>

<p>Total volume: 40 g total weight ÷ 1.2415 g/ml density per emdmillipore.com = 32 ml</p>

<p>If a lower concentration is desired for making CD/MMS, the above 50% citric acid solution could be diluted to 34% citric acid by adding 15 ml water (1 US tablespoon), for a total volume of 47 ml.</p>

<p>Concentration: 50% citric acid initial × 32 ml volume = 34% citric acid diluted × 47 ml volume.</p>

<hr class="gradient" />

<h3 id="55">Making CDS</h3>

<p>As Andreas Kalcker demonstrates in a <a href="https://odysee.com/@Kalcker:7/C%C3%B3mo-hacer-CDS--ENG:5" title="How to make CDS with Andreas Kalcker | odysee.com">video</a>, the following is a method to make CDS with neutral pH in a 3000 ppm (0.3%) concentration. He notes this is the maximum possible and always diluted to low concentration before ingestion, such as 30 ppm with <a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/cds-clo2/cds-protocols.html" title="Protocols | AndreasKalcker.com">Protocol C</a>: 10 ml of CDS 3000 ppm added to 1 liter/day water.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add 1.5 US cups (350 ml) of purified water into a labeled glass food jar. Less air inside is better. If using a metal lid, cover the underneath in plastic wrap to avoid reaction with chlorine dioxide gas.</li>

<li>Add 1 US teaspoon (5 ml) of 24% sodium chlorite solution and 1 US teaspoon (5 ml) of acid solution (4% hydrochloric acid or 50% citric acid) into a small container, such as a tall shot glass or plastic cap that will float. Place the small container inside the jar. The sodium chlorite + acid solution should not come in contact with the water. Tightly seal the jar with lid and place in a dark location at room temperature for 12–24 hours.</li>

<li>Optional: Before opening, refridgerate the sealed jar for 2–3 hours to increase the CDS concentration.</li>

<li>Open the jar in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing fumes. Remove the small container and discard its contents, or save for use as a disinfectant.</li>

<li>Repeat steps 2–4 for a second time to increase the CDS concentration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Store CDS tightly sealed in a dark location. Refridgerate when possible; above 52 °F (11 °C) gaseous chlorine dioxide in solution will diffuse into air. After six months CDS can lose half its potency, depending on how it is stored. If spilled on cloth, rinse to avoid staining.</p>

<h3 id="56">My Experience</h3>

<p>For prevention I take chlorine dioxide daily while fasting, and would definitely use it during illness if needed. I have used CD/MMS (made with hydrochloric acid) and CDS (Protocol C), and experienced no adverse effects. I briefly tried CD/MMS made with citric acid which caused gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>

<p>Studies have shown CDS to benefit oral health and eliminate bacteria that cause cavities. Its neutral pH does not affect tooth enamel. To dilute CDS to approximately 120 ppm, I add two US teaspoons of CDS 3000 ppm and 1 US cup of purified water into a glass bottle, and store tightly sealed with plastic cap in the refridgerator. I regularly use this as mouthwash and swallow afterward.</p>

<p>After an insect flew into my left eye, the next day the inside corner of the eye began to sting, water, and discharge mucus. For these symptoms of a blocked tear duct and potential infection, I repeatedly applied drops of CDS diluted to 300 ppm and <a href="#21" title="Another section">ionic nanoparticle silver</a> 20 ppm. There was immediate pain relief and the condition quickly resolved.</p>

<p>In the following book, Dr. Morton Walker describes his view that DMSO has the largest potential number of uses ever documented for a single chemical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Morton Walker, DPM. DMSO: Nature’s Healer (1st ed., p. 4). Avery 1993.</p>

<p>The people have a new medical breakthrough for pain: dimethyl sulfoxide, called DMSO. By itself or in combination with other medical ingredients, dimethyl sulfoxide should be useful in treating almost every disease known to mankind. The substance, a byproduct of pulp and paper manufacturing, has been employed safely and successfully by millions of people around the world to control swelling; reduce discomfort; take away inflammation; slow the growth of, and in many instances kill, bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It heals burns and relieves sprains, strains, and arthritic joints. It has worked effectively against cataracts, sports injuries, scleroderma, myasthenia gravis, tuberculosis, and even lessened mental retardation in people with Down’s syndrome.</p>

<p>Cancer seems to respond well to DMSO. At Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, Charlotte Friend, M.D., has turned cancerous cells into harmless normal ones in the test tube by putting them in touch with the DMSO solutions. Thus, DMSO cancer research is in progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DMSO is a solvent that easily passes through skin capillaries without damage to carry other substances (but not pathogens) deeper into body tissues and organs. Once in the bloodstream, DMSO enters nearly every organ system within an hour. It has powerful antioxidant properties, protects against radiation damage, and facilitates DNA repair. DMSO can help remove toxic heavy metals and other chemicals that accumulate in the body. It can promote healing by increasing blood supply to area of injury, serve as an anti-inflammatory agent, and provide pain relief.</p>

<p>DMSO can be effective against some pathogens and cancers. The <a href="https://www.dmso.org/articles/information/herschler.htm" title="Pharmacology of DMSO | Stanley W. Jacob and Robert Herschler">article</a> "Pharmacology of DMSO" references studies that found DMSO at 80% concentration inactivated DNA and RNA viruses, influenza A and A-2 viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and Semliki Forest virus. For its ability to enter affected cells and carry other substances along, DMSO has been used in antiviral remedies and therapy for breast, leukemia, lung, lymphoma, and prostate cancers. DMSO can oxidize cancer cells to destroy them, and kill pleomorphic microbes that cause cancer and autoimmune diseases.</p>

<p>Dr. Stanley Jacob discovered the medicinal properties of DMSO and pioneered its medical use, which has led to more than 20,000 scientific publications. The book "Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) in Trauma and Disease" (Stanley W. Jacob, MD., Jack C. de la Torre MD, PhD. CRC Press 2015) examines the major clinical uses in humans and presents the collective data on biological, chemical, and medical actions of DMSO.</p>

<p>A 1994 <a href="https://www.dmso.org/articles/interstitialcystitis/icu.htm" title="An Interview With Dr. Stanley Jacob: Discussing DMSO | DMSO.org">interview</a> mentions, "Dr. Jacob has also been swallowing a teaspoon of DMSO every day for the past 32 years, and hasn’t had a cold or flu during that time." A 2016 <a href="https://www.docgriffith.com/post/2016/09/14/-father-of-dmso-passes-at-91" title="Father of DMSO Passes at 91 | DocGriffith.com">article</a> remarks how Dr. Jacob was able to work 6 days per week from 5AM–6PM until 90 years old. DMSO can increase blood flow in the brain, dissolve amyloids, and protect against dementia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Archie H. Scott. The DMSO Handbook for Doctors (1st ed., p. 16). iUniverse 2013.</p>

<p>As a person ages circulation usually gradually becomes impaired. This can result in a lack of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. With a reduced amount of oxygen and nutrients brain cells can be injured or killed. DMSO can prevent this from happening. DMSO also helps the neurons in the brain to communicate with each other. All of this helps enable the person to retain mental capabilities into advanced age.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="90">Safety</h3>

<p>Studies found that extremely high dosages of DMSO affected the eyes of some animals, but had no effect on the eyes of human and monkeys. Despite considerable evidence of safety in humans, DMSO is prohibited from general use (in favor of lucrative medications).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Morton Walker, DPM. DMSO: Nature’s Healer (1st ed., pp. 76-77). Avery 1993.</p>

<p>At the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Scherbel had forty-four people under treatment for scleroderma. Some patients received as much as 3 g/kg per day and were treated for as long as twenty-three months. None of them showed the characteristic lens changes that were observed in the DMSO-treated animals.</p>

<p>When 11 g/kg of DMSO was applied to the skin of monkeys and 5 g/kg was given to them to drink each day for a full year, no lens changes occurred. The laboratory workers suspected that the eye changes were specific only for dogs, rabbits, and pigs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical companies continued to collect case reports in which no real toxicity of any kind was being observed. Merck and Company gradually collected 17,000 patient reports. Syntex collected approximately 7,000 and E.R. Squibb and Sons around 3,000. The FDA seemed to turn a blind eye to these human case studies, although DMSO was officially banned from human experimental use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following human study found that higher than typical DMSO dosage had no significant adverse effects, with only minor side effects from concentration and route of administration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Stanley W. Jacob, MD., Jack C. de la Torre MD, PhD. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) in Trauma and Disease (1st ed., p. 70). CRC Press 2015.</p>

<p>A short-term study (14 days) and a long-term study (90 days) were undertaken by Brobyn, who reported his findings on 213 healthy human volunteers. These volunteers were periodically examined by specialists after being administered 1 g/kg/day 80% DMSO daily. This dose was considered 3–30 times higher than the typical DMSO dose used or recommended. The specific clinical examinations included complete physical examinations with laboratory examinations of blood and urine, ophthalmologic, dermatologic, cardiologic, neurologic, pulmonary function, and bone marrow studies.</p>

<p>The results of this study concluded that no significant adverse effects from either the short-term or long-term administration of DMSO were observed after a very extensive toxicology study was conducted. Minor side effects of DMSO administered daily included skin irritation, nausea, sedation, and diarrhea, which resolved following discontinuation of DMSO. DMSO at 3–30 times the usual treatment dose in humans appeared as a relatively very safe drug, and in particular, no lens changes that were seen to occur in some animal species were detected in any subject after extensive ophthalmological examinations after 3-month follow-up. This absence of ocular changes after high and prolonged administration of DMSO has been fully confirmed in other studies. There has not been another major toxicological study on topical DMSO following Brobyn’s report, but thousands of papers dealing with DMSO and its various routes administration, including intravenous, oral, dermal, and intravesical, have reported that adverse reactions are relatively mild and usually can occur in relation to its concentration and its mode of administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2262105/" title="Cytotoxic effects of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) on cochlear organotypic cultures | PubMed">study</a> examined potential cytotoxic side effects of DMSO when directly applied to inner ear. In testing with rats, DMSO concentrations of 0.1% and 0.25% caused little or no damage, but concentrations of 0.5% or higher were toxic to both inner and outer hair cells important for hearing.</p>

<p>In the book "DMSO: Nature’s Healer" (Avery 1993), Dr. Morton Walker notes on page 69, "the use of massive doses of DMSO (2 gm. per kilogram body weight) in the treatment of heart attacks" and on page 262, "In the treatment of massive stroke, extremely large doses of DMSO are required for a good result. The initial dose is 2 g per kg of body weight."</p>

<p>In the book "MMS Health Recovery Guidebook" (2016) on pages 227–245, Jim Humble describes the following protocol for heart attack and stroke. This could be lifesaving in a remote area where medical assistance is not immediately available. The CD/MMS (<a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a>) is not mixed in the same cup with DMSO. The CD/MMS is taken within two minutes after a dose of DMSO.</p>

<div class="lined-border">
Day 1<br />
1st hour<br />
Every 15 minutes: 2 US tablespoons DMSO in 1/2 cup water.<br />
Single dose: 6 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.<br />
<br />
2nd hour<br />
Every 15 minutes: 1 US tablespoon DMSO in 1/4 cup water.<br />
Single dose: 6 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.<br />

</div>

<p>In my calculations for adults weighing 120–180 lbs, the 1st hour total DMSO dosage is approximately 1.6–2.4 g/kg, near the 2 g/kg initial dose that Dr. Walker notes in his book.</p>

<p>8 US tablespoons DMSO = 118.3 ml, × density 1.10 g/ml = 130.1 g<br />
130.1 g ÷ 54.5 kg (120 lbs) = 2.4 g/kg<br />
130.1 g ÷ 81.7 kg (180 lbs) = 1.6 g/kg</p>

<p>For adults weighing 120–180 lbs, the 1st day total DMSO dosage is approximately 4.2–6.3 g/kg. The previous section on toxicology mentions a study where monkeys drank 5 g/kg/day DMSO for a year.</p>

<p>21 US tablespoons DMSO = 310.5 ml, × density 1.10 g/ml = 341.6 g<br />
341.6 g ÷ 54.5 kg (120 lbs) = 6.3 g/kg<br />
341.6 g ÷ 81.7 kg (180 lbs) = 4.2 g/kg</p>

<h3 id="92">Dosage & Concentration</h3>

<p>In the book "DMSO: Nature’s Healer" (Avery 1993), Dr. Morton Walker notes on page 37, "the therapeutic dosage is far below the toxic dose" and on page 42, "The usual oral dosage of DMSO is one to two teaspoons per day."</p>

<p>In the book "Healing with DMSO" (Ulysses 2020), <a href="https://yummy.doctor/" title="Dr. Amandha Vollmer | Holistic Health Education">Dr. Amandha Vollmer</a> discusses adult oral and topical dosages of 0.25–6.0 US teaspoons/day pure DMSO (99+%), starting with a low dose. DMSO is usually diluted with purified water which allows deeper penetration when applied to skin. Concentrations: 20–50% topical for eyes (in saline), face, sensitive skin; 50% wounds, maximum for oral use; 70–80% topical for pain, muscle injury; 80% mixing with nutrients, soles of feet, tooth cavity; 99% physician use for pimple, scar tissue, small wound. Animal oral and topical use: up to 2 ml pure DMSO for every 10 lbs of body weight (equivalent to 0.5 g/kg/day), diluted to 20–50% concentration.</p>

<h3 id="93">Application & Caution</h3>

<p>DMSO is a powerful solvent. Avoid contact with dyed and synthetic cloth, metal jewelry, nail polish, rubber gloves, silicone implants (proximity), tattoos, and these types of plastic: ABS, PET, polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). DMSO is non-reactive to glass, stainless steel, and these types of plastic: HDPE (2), LDPE (4), Nylon, PETE (1), PP (5), and PTFE. Store DMSO in a tightly sealed container protected from light. Warming solid DMSO above 65 °F (18 °C) will turn it liquid.</p>

<p>In her book Dr. Vollmer indicates the following:</p>

<p>Skin should be washed well with water and free of undesirable chemicals including dried soap residue, since DMSO can carry it into the bloodstream. DMSO can be applied with clean hands, undyed cotton, or natural bristle paint brush. Initially apply a small amount of 20% concentration as a patch test. Allow at least 20 minutes for DMSO to dry before contact with clothing. Its effects on skin can last up to three hours so immediately wash off exposure to anything potentially toxic.</p>

<p>Brief heat and redness will occur from topical use. If too strong, applying water may reduce the effect. Repeated topical use of high concentrations can cause temporary thickening of skin, swelling, dryness, peeling, and garlic-like body odor for a few days. Staying well hydrated is important since DMSO produces a significant diuretic effect. Some may experience symptoms from detoxification or pathogenic die-off. Stop use immediately if severe allergic reaction. It is prudent to avoid DMSO while pregnant, breastfeeding, or in combination with pharmaceutical medications for which safety has not been established.</p>

<h3 id="94">My Experience</h3>

<p>I regularly use a 50% concentration of DMSO as mouthwash and swallow afterward. I have experienced no adverse effects, nor any garlic-like odor on breath or skin.</p>

<p>I repeatedly applied drops of 20% <a href="#60" title="Another section">iodine</a> together with drops of pure DMSO to my skin where I had a small sebaceous cyst, which gradually disappeared without need for excision.</p>

<p>I briefly experienced significant pain in my hands at night (working hand syndrome) after replacing the roof on my house. I used a 50% concentration of DMSO applied topically for pain relief so that I could sleep better.</p>

<p>Veterinary-grade DMSO (99+% pure) liquid sold for animal use can be considerably less expensive. I purchase this in plastic bottles and transfer to glass containers for home storage.</p>

<h2 id="23">Hydrogen Peroxide</h2>

<p>A brief history of hydrogen peroxide in medical use:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n18.shtml" title="Hospital Study Shows that Covid-19 Can be Prevented with Hydrogen Peroxide | Orthomolecular.org">Hospital Study Shows that Covid-19 Can be Prevented with Hydrogen Peroxide</a>. Orthomolecular Medicine News Service 2022.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide is a well-known antiseptic, used extensively in dentistry and to disinfect surfaces and instruments. But many are unaware that hydrogen peroxide is a natural molecule that exists everywhere in the body, including in the immune/defensive cells that have very important biological functions to protect the body from disease.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide was discovered over 200 years ago in 1818, and in 1856 it was found to be present in the human body. In 1888, hydrogen peroxide was reported for the first time to be effective for treating numerous diseases, including scarlet fever, diphtheria, nasal catarrh, acute coryza (rhinitis), whooping cough, asthma, hay fever and tonsillitis. It was also used as an oral and nasal antiseptic in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, hydrogen peroxide was found to have a protective effect on myocardial ischemia. Intravenous infusion of hydrogen peroxide has been studied and promoted for the treatment of various diseases including cancer, skin diseases, polio and bacteria-related mental illness, even in pain relief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="34">In the article, Dr. Cheng describes a study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9113766/" title="Further observations on hydrogen peroxide antisepsis and COVID-19 cases… | PubMed">published</a> in the Journal of Hospital Infection. Dr. Albert Amoah, Dr. Seth Ayettey, and their team reported that from April through December 2021 at two hospitals in Ghana, 4000+ inpatients and 146 healthcare workers used hydrogen peroxide 1–2 times daily. For nasal rinsing, they used 2–3 large drops per each nostril with a 0.5% concentration. For mouthwashing and gargling, they used a 1% concentration for one minute. None of the study participants developed COVID-19 infection while using hydrogen perxoide for prevention, except for one worker who had discontinued regular use. Other <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n19.shtml" title="HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19: AN OVERVIEW | Orthomolecular.org">studies</a> found similar results.</p>

<h3>Nebulization</h3>

<p>A compressor and nebulizer are designed to convert liquid into aerosol breathed in through a mouthpiece or mask. In his COVID-19 <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2023/01/08/safety-of-high-dose-vit-c-d-etc-in-covid-management/" title="Safety of High Dose Vit C, D etc in Covid Management | DrWlC.com">protocols</a> for patients, Dr. Cheng has included nebulization of 1–3% hydrogen peroxide for 5–15 minutes, 3–4 times/day. He published the following from Dr. Thomas E. Levy:</p>

<p>There are few molecules in the body, if any, that are singularly more important for optimal health than hydrogen peroxide (HP). It is essential for the ongoing defense against pathogens while also playing a pivotal role in the regulation of normal metabolism. HP is present throughout the body, continually generated both inside and outside of all cells (Boveris and Chance, 1973; Bao et al., 2009; Rice, 2011). HP is literally a naturally-generated antibiotic "designed by nature" to give the body its best chance at preventing an infection or at resolving an infection once contracted. It is also intimately involved in vital messaging and signaling functions between different cells as well as inside the cells themselves in order to sustain normal metabolic function. Furthermore, HP is present in the body in significant amounts, with some data indicating that as much as 5% of oxygen intake is utilized in the generation of HP (Arnaiz et al., 1999). An extremely simple molecule, HP presents no toxicity to the body except when arbitrarily administered in very high doses and concentrations, conditions that can literally make any substance toxic.</p>

<p>Regular off-the shelf 3% HP can be utilized. Preparations of greater pharmacological purity can be obtained if desired (food grade). Food grade HP typically comes in concentrations greater than 3% and must be appropriately diluted. HP in a concentration greater than 3% should never be nebulized.</p>

<p>For most adults, the 3% concentration can be utilized in the nebulization chamber undiluted. This optimizes the degree and rapidity of the antiviral and anti-pathogen effect. However, don’t be reluctant to dilute the 3% solution if not easily tolerated. Note that the first few partial inhalations might not be well-tolerated, but these initial inhalations effectively "coat" the mucous membranes with the HP mist, and subsequent inhalations are not only well-tolerated but relaxing. However, never continue inhaling any agent that makes breathing more difficult.</p>

<p>In a September 2020 <a href="https://archive.org/details/sep-2020-dr-joseph-mercola-interviews-dr-david-brownstein" title="Sep 2020 Dr Joseph Mercola Interviews Dr David Brownstein | Internet Archive">interview</a>, Dr. David Brownstein describes how for decades his patients have successfully used nebulization of hydrogen peroxide and iodine in recovery from respiratory infection, including the recent COVID-19 virus. While discussing formulation, Dr. Joseph Mercola suggests to dilute hydrogen peroxide with "normal saline so that you don’t have an osmotic differential and cause damage to the cells in the lungs when you’re nebulizing this if it was a distilled water preparation." In March 2021 I emailed Dr. Levy with a question about this and he replied, "Normal saline is fine, but I don’t think damage is being done with water dilution."</p>

<p>Dr. Levy published a free e-book <a href="https://rvr.medfoxpub.com/" title="Rapid Virus Recovery | MedFox">Rapid Virus Recovery</a> (MedFox 2021) about hydrogen peroxide and other therapies. In an April 2021 <a href="https://archive.org/details/apr-2021-dr-joseph-mercola-interviews-dr-thomas-e-levy" title="Apr 2021 Dr Joseph Mercola Interviews Dr Thomas E Levy | Internet Archive">interview</a> by Dr. Joseph Mercola, Dr. Levy mentions that swallowing pathogens may impact health of gut and patients with chronic irritable bowel syndrome have been helped by nebulization of hydrogen peroxide. Both physicians personally use this therapy at onset of respiratory symptoms to stay healthy.</p>

<p>In a 2021 <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n13.shtml" title="Hydrogen Peroxide Nebulization and COVID Resolution | Orthomolecular.org">article</a>, Dr. Levy reports that nebulization longer than 15 minutes can offer additional benefit and 3% hydrogen peroxide is optimal in most cases. He describes successful use in Colombia by 20 people with viral infection, most significantly ill and some with severe respiratory difficulty. They nebulized pharmacy over-the-counter 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes, 3 times/day for the first two days and all felt much better. For the next three days, they continued nebulization with 1.5–3% hydrogen peroxide and afterward all had recovered.</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<p>I regularly use diluted hydrogen peroxide for gargling, mouthwashing, and nasal rinsing as described in the study above.</p>

<p>I nebulized 3% hydrogen peroxide short term at onset of flu symptoms which quickly resolved. I breathed in deeply through the mouthpiece, slowly exhaled through my nose to use my entire airway, and experienced no adverse effects.</p>

<p>In spring 2020 I read about a variety of models and determined that the "PARI Vios LC Plus" had a reputation for reliability, efficiency, moderate noise level, and customer support with 5 year warranty. I purchased this model (PP310F83LCPLUS) from BuyMedical.com with 30 day return policy and no prescription required. I bought extra "PARI LC Plus reusable nebulizer cup with wingtip tubing" from DirectHomeMedical.com. The compressor and nebulizers work quite well.</p>

<h2 id="21">Ionic Nanoparticle Silver (Nanosilver)</h2>

<p>I read physicians mention ionic nanoparticle silver for short-term use during viral infection, up to 6 US teaspoons/day nebulized or swallowed. They indicated this may also be beneficial when applied topically against wound infection, or taken internally during other types of infection.</p>

<p>Ionic nanoparticle silver should not be confused with colloidal silver, which is a different form considered outdated and far less effective due to its much larger particles. Ionic nanoparticle silver does not cause argyria, a discoloration of skin known to occur from excessive use of colloidal silver.</p>

<p>Studies on ionic nanoparticle silver have found antimicrobial properties:</p>

<p>Excerpt from Herbert Slavin, MD. <a href="http://www.silverfacts.com/powerful.pdf" title="Ionic Silver – The Powerful Defense Against Viruses And Other Microbes | Health Freedom News">Ionic Silver – The Powerful Defense Against Viruses And Other Microbes</a>. Health Freedom News 2006;24(3):22–29.</p>

<p>In Europe, ionic silver is recognized as an accepted treatment for viral conditions. Walk into a pharmacy in Europe and tell them you’ve been diagnosed with a cold or flu — which is viral in nature — and they will look in their desk reference and find a number of silver-ion compounds or complexes listed as remedies to sell you. It seems the United States is finally catching on. A study at the University of Arizona recently showed ionic silver to be effective against the coronavirus that researchers use as the surrogate for SARS. A study out of the University of Texas reportedly suggested ionic silver may be effective against HIV-1, and researchers expect it may be shown effective against other viruses and bacteria as well. "We’re testing against other viruses and the ’super bug (Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus),’ said Miguel Jose Yacaman, from University of Texas, Department of Engineering and one of the study’s authors. “Our preliminary results indicate that silver nanoparticles can effectively attack other micro-organisms."</p>

<p>For centuries, silver (Ag) has been known to have antibacterial properties and, over the past two decades, Ag-based nanoparticles have gained traction as potential antimicrobials. The antibacterial efficacy of Ag varies with structure, size, and concentration. In the present study, we examined Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) for their antimicrobial activity and safety. We compared different commercially-available AgNPs against gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant and susceptible strains. The most effective formula of AgNPs tested had single-digit (μg/mL) minimum inhibitory concentrations against gram-negative multidrug-resistant clinical bacterial isolates with novel and emerging mechanisms of resistance. The mode of killing was assessed in E. coli and was found to be bactericidal, which is consistent with previous studies using other AgNP formulations.</p>

<p>"Nanosilver is about 40 times more effective than colloidal silver compounds."</p>

<p>"Nanosilver has a very high therapeutic value because there is no known LD50 for nanosilver, and there is only one known deleterious side effect — argyria — and the only known side effect does not apply to nanosilver speciation, but only to colloidal silver compounds, especially silver salts. The effective dose, on the other hand, is very low when compared to a strictly theoretical lethal dose."</p>

<p>"Nano/picoscalar silver was tested against silver sulfadiazine and found to be 10-100 times more lethal against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Its efficacy was largely due to its surface area coverage, which was estimated to approach six square kilometers per cubic centimeter of product."</p>

<p>"Metal chelators (such as nanosilver) have been shown to form metal-linked dimers (two molecules linked together). By chelation (which is a process similar to the way in which silver is absorbed out of the soil by plants) to the proteins and glycoproteins, nanosilver intervenes in the virus’ life cycle, interrupting the ability of the virus to replicate."</p>

<p>"The most effective administration of the nanosilver into the body in the specific case of SARS (an URTI disease) would be to nebulize, or atomize, or vaporize, the SDC through a mechanical device, whereby the patient could breathe the nanosilver directly into the lungs. The sub-micron particles would then penetrate the viral envelope."</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<p>After an insect flew into my left eye, the next day the inside corner of the eye began to sting, water, and discharge mucus. For these symptoms of a blocked tear duct and potential infection, I repeatedly applied drops of ionic nanoparticle silver 20 ppm and <a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide solution (CDS)</a> diluted to 300 ppm. There was immediate pain relief and the condition quickly resolved.</p>

<p>In spring 2020 I purchased "Silver Doc Silver Hydrosol by Research Labs 32 oz" which was competitively priced, made in a certified Utah lab, and had an established reputable history. One US teaspoon of this 0.8 nanometer (0.008 micron) 20 ppm ionic nanoparticle silver solution contains 0.1 mg of elemental silver. Plain drinking water can contain up to 0.1 mg of elemental silver per liter and be within U.S. EPA safety guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="25">Melatonin</h2>

<p>Melatonin is found naturally in plants and animals. Production in humans occurs in the pineal gland and mitochondria of cells, and diminishes with age. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant, can increase glutathione levels, works synergistically with vitamin D, and regulates sleep-wake cycle. Supplemental melatonin has a high safety profile and can improve sleep quality, attenuate inflammation and oxidation, regulate high blood pressure and insulin resistance, and prevent mitochondrial impairment.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Z. Cheng has included 5–20 mg/night melatonin as a powerful immune booster in his COVID-19 <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2023/01/08/safety-of-high-dose-vit-c-d-etc-in-covid-management/" title="Safety of High Dose Vit C, D etc in Covid Management | DrWlC.com">protocols</a> for patients. In 2023 listed at <a href="https://c19early.org/j" title="COVID-19 early treatment: real-time analysis">COVID-19 Treatment Studies for Melatonin</a> are nine studies from nine independent teams in five countries which show statistically significant improvement, with an average 48% lower mortality. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may receive a higher dosage (e.g. 36–72 mg/day melatonin in four divided doses) to inhibit cytokine storm and sepsis.</p>

<p>If researching MSM, it is also known as crystalline dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone, methyl sulfone, methylsulfonylmethane, organic sulfur, and sulfonylbismethane.</p>

<p>MSM is a sulfur-based compound found naturally in plants and animals. Supplemental MSM is a water-soluble, crystalline powder made from oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide (<a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a>). It is nontoxic in therapeutic dosage and can be used orally or topically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpts from M Butawan, RL Benjamin, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372953/" title="Methylsulfonylmethane: Applications and Safety of a Novel Dietary Supplement | PubMed">Methylsulfonylmethane: Applications and Safety of a Novel Dietary Supplement</a>. Nutrients 2017;9(3):290.</p>
<p>"Biochemically, this manufactured MSM would have no detectable structural or safety differences from the naturally produced product [51]. Since the concentration of MSM is in the hundredths ppm in food sources, synthetically produced MSM makes it possible to ingest bioactive quantities without having to consume unrealistic amounts of food."</p>
<p>"Whether naturally produced or manufactured, MSM exhibits no biochemical differences in its ability to intermediate oxidative stress and inflammation."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="68">Benefit</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/msm-supplements" title="8 Science-Backed Benefits of MSM Supplements | Healthline">Studies</a> have found that supplemental MSM has antioxidant properties and can increase glutathione levels, benefit immune system, prevent and inhibit cancer, and improve skin health.</p>

<p>MSM is an anti-inflammatory agent that has proven effective for relief from various conditions such as allergy, arthritis, asthma, back pain, Bell's palsy, Buerger's disease, burn, bursitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, constipation, dental pain, fibromyalgia, headache, heartburn and hyperacidity, infection, inflammatory bowel disorder (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), interstitial cystitis, joint pain, lupus, muscle pain or spasm, rosacea, scleroderma, shingles, sinitus, tendintis, and TMJ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Stanley W. Jacob, MD., Ronald W. Laurence, MD., Martin Zucker. The Miracle of MSM: The Natural Solution for Pain (1st ed., pp. 7–8). Berkley 1999.</p>

<p>Two of us (Jacob and Lawrence) are medical doctors with nearly ninety years of combined clinical experience treating severe and debilitating pain problems. One of us (Jacob) participated in the development of MSM and was the first physician to use MSM in the treatment of patients nearly twenty years ago. We have both repeatedly seen MSM significantly ease the suffering of patients with different types of pain and inflammatory conditions and restore their ability to function more normally. In our opinion, MSM can greatly reduce the staggering amount of disability and loss of productivity caused by chronic pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="69">Dosage</h3>

<p>In the above book, the authors suggest adult oral dosages of 2 g/day MSM for general maintenance and health, 2–8 g/day MSM for therapeutic use, and up to 40–60 g/day MSM for severe conditions supervised by a physician. Noticeable improvement may occur immediately, within days, or take months depending on condition.</p>

<p>In their clinical experience, MSM is safe for long-term daily use. Dr. Stanley Jacob personally took it regularly for many years. Tests have shown this to increase liver activity, which is not necessarily a sign of liver pathology. Patients taking a blood-thinning medication should exercise caution when using MSM.</p>

<p>They suggest starting with a low dosage and slowly increasing as needed. Taking MSM in divided doses and with meals may help avoid gastrointestinal discomfort. Generally if the body has a greater need for MSM, there is a greater tolerance for higher dosage.</p>

<p>The following article contains similar information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Walter Last. <a href="http://www.health-science-spirit.com/Healing_the_Body/MSM-as-a-Versatile-Healer.html" title="MSM Organic Sulphur as a Versatile Healer | Walter Last">MSM Organic Sulphur as a Versatile Healer</a>. Health-science-spirit.com</p>

<p>The reason for a slow increase is that MSM often causes some beneficial but uncomfortable cleansing reactions. This may result in headaches, nausea, diarrhea or weakness for a few days. If you are already on a high dose when this happens, just reduce or stop the intake until it is over. Cleansing reactions are a common and necessary part of effective natural healing methods.</p>

<p>When healthy I take 4 g/day MSM in water drank throughout the day, and have experienced no adverse effects. I also regularly apply a homemade 15% MSM solution on my face for skin health.</p>

<p>Veterinary-grade MSM (100% pure) powder sold in bulk for animal use can be considerably less expensive. Recommended shelf life is two years, and tests found no loss in potency for up to five years when stored tightly sealed at cool temperature.</p>

In May 2020 <a href="https://www.medcram.com/pages/instructors" title="Roger Seheult, MD | MedCram">Dr. Roger Seheult</a> describes in an interesting <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/E1I4tYlCkpiU/" title="N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Benefits | Bitchute">video</a>, "there is compelling research that NAC may also reduce the severity of viral infections like influenza, and perhaps reduce the risk of blood clots (thromboembolism) as well." He mentions this study:</p>

Ther Clin Risk Manag 2020;16:1047–1055.</p>

<p>To protect those who have not contracted SARS-Cov-2, oral NAC (600 mg, bid) could be an effective and economical measurement to modulate their immune systems against potential infection. Once onset symptoms appear, such as fever or dry cough, oral NAC (1200 mg, bid) could be taken to alleviate symptoms and accelerate recovery from virus infection.</p>

<p>For relatively severe patients without airway obstructions, an inhalable formula of NAC can be used with a nebulizer. Patients with allergies or asthma should take antihistamine before or during NAC inhalation, to prevent adverse reactions. Self-treatment with oral or inhalable NAC could help many SARS-Cov-2 infected patients safely recover at home.</p>

Frontiers in Immunology 2020;11:1451.</p>

<p>Quercetin displays a broad range of antiviral properties which can interfere at multiple steps of pathogen virulence — virus entry, virus replication, protein assembly — and that these therapeutic effects can be augmented by the co-administration of vitamin C. Furthermore, due to their lack of severe side effects and low-costs, we strongly suggest the combined administration of these two compounds for both the prophylaxis and the early treatment of respiratory tract infections, especially including COVID-19 patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read that a typical long-term prophylactic oral dosage considered likely safe for healthy adults is 500–1000 mg/day quercetin. Dr. Richard Z. Cheng has included 500 mg quercetin 3–4 times/day in his COVID-19 <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2023/01/08/safety-of-high-dose-vit-c-d-etc-in-covid-management/" title="Safety of High Dose Vit C, D etc in Covid Management | DrWlC.com">protocols</a> for patients. In his August 21, 2021 newsletter, <a href="https://doctormurray.com/" title="doctormurray.com">Dr. Michael Murray</a> suggests 3000 mg/day quercetin in divided doses for at least 10 days during active respiratory infection symptoms, followed by a maintenance dosage of 250 mg twice daily. He notes, "[This] high dosage may not be necessary. But my dosage calculations are based upon likely tissue concentrations needed to exert the strongest antiviral effects. And given the safety of quercetin, there is no harm at this level."</p>

<h2 id="72">Parasite Cleanse</h2>

<p>The two main types of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC126866/" title="History of Human Parasitology | PubMed">intestinal parasites</a> are protozoa (microscopic single-cell) and helminths/worms (larger multi-cell).

Medical Historical Society of NJ 2021.</p>

<p>Because of its detergent and cathartic actions, oil of turpentine, administered orally for small-intestine parasites, or as enemas for large-intestine parasites, was widely considered one of the most reliable anthelmintics known, especially against cestodes (tapeworms).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In modern times many people ignore the basic practice of deworming, whereas previous generations made it a regular part of their lives. As a precaution against potential infection, I took an oral dose of 0.5 US teaspoon natural "100% pure gum spirits" of turpentine twice a day for two weeks. I mixed it with water and experienced no adverse effects. As a male with body weight of 180 lbs (81.7 kg), each 0.5 US teaspoon dose was approximately 5% TD<sub>Lo</sub> and 1% LD<sub>Lo</sub> as described below.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">IMPORTANT</span>: I was very careful to purchase only natural turpentine labeled "100% pure gum spirits" from a reputable seller (e.g. CreekwoodNaturals.com or DiamondGForestProducts.com). Other turpentine products without that specific label (all four words) contain synthetic chemicals, some extremely toxic that damage liver.</p>

<h3 id="74">Castor Oil, Vitamin C</h3>

<p>In historical reports I read that <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil" title="Castor Oil: 4 Benefits and Uses | Healthline">castor oil</a> was commonly used as a laxative to expel intestinal parasite die-off from natural turpentine. A typical adult oral dose is 1–2 US tablespoons castor oil, taken on an empty stomach along with drinking liquid.</p>

<p>In the book "Curing the Incurable: Vitamin C, Infectious Diseases, and Toxins" (4th ed., p. 168. MedFox 2011), Dr. Thomas E. Levy remarks, "Vitamin C has demonstrated the ability to neutralize a wide variety of toxic substances, many of which are completely unrelated chemically." High-dose oral <a href="#16" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> may alleviate flu-like symptoms from toxins released by parasite die-off. It can also serve as a laxative when taken in amounts close to bowel tolerance.</p>

<h3 id="75">Kalcker Protocol P</h3>

<p>I read that <a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a> taken orally is effective for protozoa (including those that cause malaria), but not for worms. Physicians have found that chlorine dioxide solution (CDS) in therapeutic dosage is nontoxic and have used it with millions of patients.</p>

<p>Andreas Kalcker and Miriam Carrasco Maceda developed a parasite protocol for use when conventional treatments fail. It is effective for roundworms, but less so for tapeworms. The protocol is published as a 78-page chapter of Kerri Rivera’s book "Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism" (2nd ed., 2014). This is <a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/cds-clo2/protocolos-cds.html" title="CDS protocols | AndreasKalcker.com">Protocol P</a> on Kalcker’s website and in a 14-page section of his book "Forbidden Health: Incurable Was Yesterday" (Voedia 2018).</p>

<p id="26">The protocol includes enemas to cleanse the large intestine of parasite die-off, mucus biofilm, and eggs. Added to 2 liters water is chlorine dioxide, 10–20 drops CD/MMS or 10–20 ml CDS. More can be added if tolerated. For inserting liquid, it may be convenient to use a 500–1000 ml squeeze bottle with angled tip. Lay on right side and hold the liquid internally for 12–15 minutes, then sit on toilet and release liquid. Afterward drink sufficient liquid and consume electrolytes.</p>

<p>Surveys have found that 3 out of 4 physicians would refuse toxic chemotherapy for themselves. For 25 years Dr. Hardin B. Jones, professor of physiology and medical physics at UC Berkeley, studied life expectancy of cancer patients.</p>

<p>After his long period of study, Dr. Jones concluded that despite popular belief, chemotherapy doesn’t work at all! He noticed that after reviewing different kinds of cancer cases, those who had chemotherapy died faster than those who didn’t. In fact, "People who refused treatment lived for an average of 12 ½ years (more)," said Dr. Jones whose findings were published in the journal "Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences". "Those who accepted other kinds of treatment lived an average of only 3 years," he added.</p>

Krokowski and other physicians.</p>

<p>For cancer, the following is what I personally would do and not medical advice. In terms of priority if limited budget: (1) chlorine dioxide during day and sodium bicarbonate at night; (2) wheatgrass juice; (3) iodine and boron from homemade solutions; and (4) DMSO and supplements. I would also do a <a href="#72" title="Another section">parasite cleanse</a>.</p>

<h3 id="96">Chlorine Dioxide</h3>

<p>Drink diluted <a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a> (CD/MMS) in a tightly sealed glass bottle (no metal) every 30 minutes throughout each day. Follow <a href="#64" title="Another section">this</a> CD/MMS protocol but more rapidly increase to maximum dosage tolerable.</p>

<p>If consuming antioxidant supplements, take them at night before sleep so they will not interfere with daytime effectiveness of chlorine dioxide.</p>

<h3 id="97">Sodium Bicarbonate</h3>

<p>If healthy cardiovascular and kidney function, at night on an empty stomach drink sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) dissolved in water in divided doses. Taking it at night avoids interference with daytime effectiveness of chlorine dioxide and digestion of food. On my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale, a packed leveled 1 US teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate weighed approximately 6.5 g.</p>

<p>Begin with an oral dosage of 0.25 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate, which is 2–3 packed level US teaspoons for a 120–180 lbs (54.5–81.7 kg) adult. Adjust dosage as needed to obtain a urine pH between 8.0 and 8.5, tested upon waking in the morning. Reduce dosage if pH gets too high or experience symptoms of metabolic alkalosis such as confusion, hand tremor, lightheadedness, muscle twitching, nausea, numbness or tingling in face, hands, or feet. After recovery from cancer, adjust dosage as needed to obtain a urine pH of 7.4. Supplement with <a href="#66" title="Another section">vitamin B complex</a> to avoid depletion by long-term regular use of sodium bicarbonate.</p>

<p>Excerpt from IF Robey, AM Lopez, DJ Roe. <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/safety-and-tolerability-of-longterm-sodium-bicarbonate-consumption-in-cancer-care-2329-6771.1000128.pdf" title="Safety and Tolerability of Long-Term Sodium Bicarbonate… | HilarisPublisher.com">Safety and Tolerability of Long-Term Sodium Bicarbonate Consumption in Cancer Care</a>. J Integr Oncol 2015;4(1):1000128.</p>

<p>Invasive cancer develops from solid tumors cycling through multiple stages of somatic evolution. Heritable changes are driven by the hostile microenvironment [1]. Low extracellular pH or acidity (pH 6.5-6.7) is a major hallmark of the hostile tumor microenvironment, and a driver of metastatic potential in solid tumors such as breast and prostate [2-4]. Several studies in mouse models for cancer have demonstrated that tumor acidity can be raised or buffered to physiological pH (7.2) through oral administration of a buffering agent [5-7]. The effect of systemic buffering has been shown to reduce tumor aggression in these animal models, by preventing the spread of metastases [7,8], improving disease-free survival [7,8], inhibiting pH-sensitive invasion enzymes [7,9,10], reducing the number of circulating tumor cells [9], and reducing tumor macroautophagy [11]. In most of these animal studies the buffer treatment was sodium bicarbonate.</p>

<h3 id="98">Wheatgrass Juice</h3>

<p>If possible, grow <a href="https://hippocratesinst.org/about-us/the-diet/wheatgrass-juice-benefits/" title="Wheatgrass Juice Benefits | Hippocrates Institute">wheatgrass</a> and consume the juice at night. It is exceptionally high in vitamin B17 (amygdalin) which can be effective against cancer.</p>

<h3 id="99">Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)</h3>

<p><a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a> can increase effectiveness of chlorine dioxide against cancer. Take up to 3–5 US tablespoons (adult dosage of 1 g/kg/day) pure DMSO diluted with purified water in another glass bottle separate from chlorine dioxide, and consume both at the same time throughout each day.</p>

<h3 id="100">Diet & Supplements</h3>

<p>Do <a href="#3" title="Another section">alternate-day fasting</a>. On fasting days, consume no calories. Fast longer than one day when tolerable.</p>

<p>On eating days, limit calorie intake to minimum needed. Review list of <a href="#4" title="Another section">foods</a>. Focus on non-starchy vegetables and healthy fats (especially <a href="#7" title="Another section">flaxseed</a>), with limited complex carbohydrates and fruit to avoid spikes in blood sugar which can feed cancer growth. Minimize consumption of animal <a href="#27" title="Another section">proteins</a> which can promote cancer from excess release of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) by the liver.</p>

<p>Take <a href="#10" title="Another section">supplements</a> at night, including homemade solutions of 150 mg/day <a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a> and 20 mg/day <a href="#11" title="Another section">boron</a> (adult dosages).</p>

<p>If budget permits, at night before sleep take LivOn Labs <a href="#49" title="Another section">liposomal</a> vitamin C and drink the following mixed with purified water. Consider using higher than these adult dosages when monitored for toxicity.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://nootriment.com/alpha-lipoic-acid-dosage/" title="Alpha Lipoic Acid Dosage Guidelines & Dangers of Using Too Much| Nootriment.com">alpha-lipoic acid (ALA)</a> 1800 mg/day (e.g. bulksupplements.com).</li>
    <li><a href="#67" title="Another section">methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)</a>, maximum amount without diarrhea.</li>
    <li><a href="#35" title="Another section">niacin</a> 3–4 g/day</li>
    <li><a href="#24" title="Another section">quercetin</a> 1000 mg/day</li>
    <li><a href="#37" title="Another section">selenium</a> 800 mcg/day. The highly bioavailable form of <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n30.shtml" title="…The Roles of Cysteine and Selenocysteine | Orthomolecular.org">methylselenocysteine</a> has produced positive results in clinical cancer studies.</li>
    <li><a href="#43" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> as ascorbic acid, maximum amount without diarrhea.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vitamin C can be significantly more effective for cancer when combined with the supplements listed above, including alpha-lipoic acid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Steve Hickey, PhD., Hilary Roberts, PhD. The Cancer Breakthrough: A Nutritional Approach for Doctors and Patients (1st ed., p. 69).  Lulu 2007.</p>

<p>In combination, high concentrations of vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid are more than five times as powerful as vitamin C alone. When combined, they cause greater cancer cell death than if taken separately. This feature is described as synergy: the combination is greater than the sum of the individual effects. Importantly, combination does not seem to increase toxicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="101">Additional Treatment</h3>

<p>If budget permits, 2–3 days per week take high-dose IV vitamin C. Dr. Robert F. Cathcart III describes in a <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/vitciv.html" title="Preparation of Sodium Ascorbate for IV and IM Use | Dr. Robert F. CathCart III">publication</a> how he prepared this. Include in the IV if available: alpha-lipoic acid, DMSO, selenium, and vitamin K3. Drinking DMSO during the IV may also increase effectiveness. Suspend use of chlorine dioxide during the IV.</p>

<p>For lung cancer, frequently nebulize the following. Allow two hours between the two different options and do not combine.</p>

<ul>
    <li>3% <a href="#23" title="Another section">hydrogen peroxide</a></li>
    <li>9–18 mg <a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a> added to 0.5–1.0 US teaspoon sterile purified water</li>
</ul>

<p>For cancer of large intestine, do <a href="#26" title="Another section">enemas</a> with the following one or more times per day. Allow two hours between the two different options and do not combine. Never use DMSO in enemas.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a> (as drops of CD/MMS, or CDS 3000 ppm) diluted with purified water</li>
    <li><a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a>, <a href="#30" title="Another section">20% vitamin C solution</a>, wheatgrass juice, and purified water</li>
</ul>

<p>For cancer of breast, prostate, or skin: frequently apply the following to the affected area. Use cotton gauze as a patch to soak the skin. Allow two hours between the two different options and do not combine. Rinse skin with water and dry before applying a different option.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a> (as drops of CD/MMS, or CDS 3000 ppm) and <a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a></li>
    <li><a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a>, <a href="#30" title="Another section">20% vitamin C solution</a>, wheatgrass juice, and <a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="28">Skin Care</h2>

<p>In the past from extensive sun exposure, I experienced noticeable hyperpigmentation on my face. Then I adopted the following approach and my skin looks much healthier.</p>

<p>I apply niacinamide and vitamin C separately since they are best absorbed at different pH levels. I use fingers to spread these on my face with head tilted back and am careful to avoid my eyes. I store these in Aozita 2 oz (60 ml) glass dropper bottles in the refridgerator and shake before use. I use up the vitamin C solution before it eventually turns yellow-brown from oxidation.</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 id="29">20% Niacinamide Solution</h3>

<p>Niacinamide (vitamin B3) in <a href="https://www.dermatologytimes.com/view/anti-aging-effects-niacinamide" title="The anti-aging effects of niacinamide | Dermatology Times">topical use</a> can help fade pigmentation, prevent UV damage and skin cancer, reduce inflammation and redness, reduce skin sallowness (yellowing), reduce fine lines and wrinkles, reduce pore size and improve skin texture, regulate oil production to clear acne and reduce dryness, and strengthen the skin barrier.</p>

<p>I apply and leave on a small amount of a homemade solution of niacinamide (BulkSupplements.com vitamin B3 niacinamide powder 500 grams 1.1 lb) dissolved in purified water in a 2 oz dropper bottle. A packed leveled 2.75 US teaspoons powder (11.0 g) in 3 US tablespoons water (44.4 g) = 19.9% weight/weight.</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 id="30">20% Vitamin C Solution</h3>

<p><a href="https://thedermreview.com/l-ascorbic-acid-acid/" title="L-ascorbic Acid | The Derm Review">Studies</a> found <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2009/5/revitalizing-aging-skin-with-topical-vitamin-c" title="Revitalize Aging Skin with Topical Vitamin C | Life Extension">that</a> topical vitamin C can brighten skin, fade dark spots, maintain skin barrier, reduce free-radical damage from sunlight, reduce inflammation, and regenerate vitamin E in skin.</p>

<p>I apply and leave on a small amount of a homemade solution of <a href="#47" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> (ascorbic acid powder) dissolved in purified water in a 2 oz dropper bottle. A packed leveled 2 US teaspoons powder (11.0 g) in 3 US tablespoons water (44.4 g) = 19.9% weight/weight.</p>

<p>Afterward I sometimes spread drops of <a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a> (50% concentration) on my face to increase skin penetration of the vitamin C.</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 id="31">3% Salicylic Acid in Grapeseed Oil</h3>

<p>Salicylic acid has anti-inflammatory <a href="https://theskincareedit.com/salicylic-acid" title="What Is Salicylic Acid: How It Works… | The Skincare Edit">properties</a> and can exfoliate skin to keep pores clear and reduce acne. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791365/" title="The Effects of Topically Applied Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid on Ultraviolet Radiation-Induced… | PubMed">Studies</a> indicate <a href="https://www.acne.org/does-salicylic-acid-make-your-skin-more-sensitive-to-the-sun.html" title="Does Salicylic Acid Make Your Skin More Sensitive to the Sun? | Acne.org">that</a> salicylic acid has a photoprotective effect and does not increase sensitivity to sunlight.</p>

<p>Grapeseed oil <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/grapeseed-oil-for-skin" title="Grapeseed Oil for Skin: Benefits and Uses | Healthline">benefits</a> include anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, proanthocyanidin to even out skin tone, and a synergistic effect with vitamin C and E to protect skin from UV damage.</p>

<p>I apply and leave on a small amount of a homemade solution of salicylic acid (Ebay.com seller "flea-market-store" salicylic acid powder) dissolved in grapeseed oil in a glass jar with lid. A packed leveled 1/4 US teaspoon powder (1.25 g) in 3 US tablespoons oil (42 g) = 2.9% weight/weight.</p>

<p>To make this, I heat two inches of water in a cooking pot until boiling and then turn off the heat. I remove my bottle of grapeseed oil stored in the refridgerator and add oil to the glass jar, along with salicylic acid powder. I place the glass jar into the cooking pot of hot water and stir until the powder is dissolved in the oil.</p>

<h3 id="32">37% Glycolic Acid Solution for Chemical Peel</h3>

<p>Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) commonly used in skin care. This has potential to damage skin if used incorrectly, and may temporarily increase need for sun protection due to greater skin sensitivity to sunlight. I found two <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921757/" title="Evidence and Considerations in the Application of Chemical Peels in Skin Disorders and Aesthetic Resurfacing | PubMed">publications</a> with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122508/" title="A Practical Approach to Chemical Peels | PubMed">helpful</a> information about different types of chemical peels and safety precautions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpts from Teo Soleymani, MD., Julien Lanoue, MD., et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122508/" title="A Practical Approach to Chemical Peels | PubMed">A Practical Approach to Chemical Peels</a>. Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology 2018;11(8):21–28.</p>

<p>"The most popular and time-tested superficial peeling agent is glycolic acid, an AHA derived from sugar cane. It is the smallest and simplest AHA in terms of chemical structure, and is also a highly hydrophilic molecule with the greatest bioavailability of all the AHAs. When properly used, superficial exfoliation with glycolic acid at concentrations of 30 to 50% has demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy in the treatment of superficial hyperpigmentation, mild-to-moderate chrono- and photoaging, and fine rhytides. Glycolic acid is often considered the first-line choice of chemical peeling agents for treatment of melasma."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Occasionally I do a superficial chemical peel with a small amount of a homemade solution of glycolic acid (CosChemSupply.com glycolic acid powder 99.5% crystal) dissolved in purified water in a 2 oz dropper bottle. A packed leveled 4 US teaspoons powder (17.6 g) in 2 US tablespoons water (29.6 g) = 37% weight/weight.</p>

<h3 id="33">Red Light Therapy</h3>

<p>Red light therapy, also known as photobiomodulation, may reduce inflammatory processes and hyperpigmentation photodamage from sun exposure. By stimulating mitochondria in skin cells that absorb red light particles, energy is increased for cellular repair, allowing the skin to more quickly return to normal pigmentation levels.</p>

<p>I read a variety of related information, including two <a href="https://theskincareedit.com/red-light-therapy-benefits" title="How Red Light Therapy Can Improve Your Skin | The Skincare Edit">2019</a> <a href="https://theskincareedit.com/red-light-therapy-at-home" title="How to Get Started with Red Light Therapy at Home | The Skincare Edit">articles</a> about Red Light Man high-powered light devices for home and professional use.
